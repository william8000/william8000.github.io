<p>You'd better watch out,<br>
You'd better not cry,<br>
You'd better not pout;<br>
I'm telling you why.<br>
Santa Claus is tapping<br>
Your phone.</p>
<p>He's bugging your room,<br>
He's reading your mail,<br>
He's keeping a file<br>
And running a tail.<br>
Santa Claus is tapping<br>
Your phone.</p>
<p>He hears you in the bedroom,<br>
Surveills you out of doors,<br>
And if that doesn't get the goods,<br>
Then he'll use provocateurs.</p>
<p>So -- you mustn't assume<br>
That you are secure.<br>
On Christmas Eve<br>
He'll kick in your door.<br>
Santa Claus is tapping<br>
Your phone.</p>

Bumpin' phat beats cuz the system was fly.</p>

'Bout ready to pop a cap in somebody's ass!</p>
<p>I yelled to my lady, &quot;Yo bitch peep this!&quot;<br>
She said, &quot;Stop frontin' &amp; just mind yo' bidness.&quot;</p>
<p>I said, &quot;For real ho, come check dis out!&quot;<br>

<p>To the top of the projects &amp; across the strip mall,<br>

<p>Out from his bag he pulled 3 small tings:<br>

<p>He slid down the fire exscape smoove as a cat,<br>
and busted the window wit' a big baseball bat.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Whassup, Santa? Why y'all bustin' my place?&quot;<br>
He said, &quot;You best get on up an' out my face!&quot;</p>
<p>His threads was all leatha, his chains was all gold,<br>

<p>He dropped down the duffle, Clippers logo on the side.<br>
Santa broke out da loot and my mouf popped open wide.</p>
<p>A wink of his eye and a shine off his gold toof,<br>
He cabbage patched his way back onto the roof</p>
<p>He jumped in his hooptie wit' rims made of chrome,<br>
And left to go tap that booty waitin' at home.</p>
<p>But I heard him still yellin', as he left on his romp,<br>

<p>Grandma Got Pulled Over</p>
<p>Sung to the tune: Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer</p>
<p>[Chorus:]</p>
<p>Grandma got pulled over by a trooper,<br>
Driving home from our house Christmas Eve,<br>
When you're on the road and doing sixty<br>
It's not a good idea for you to weave</p>
<p>She'd been drinking too much bourbon,<br>
And she downed a whole six pack<br>
And with all her medication,<br>
I'm surprised she did not have a heart attack</p>
<p>We got her out Christmas morning,<br>
At the local county jail,<br>
Seems that Grandpa likes to gamble<br>
So he asked us kids to please put up her bail</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>Now, we're all ashamed of Grandma<br>
We're not taking this so well,<br>
And in our church the brand new Preacher<br>
Points Grandma out and says she's going to Hell!</p>
<p>It won't be fun without our Grandma,<br>
The Judge gave her sixty days<br>
And we just can't help but wonder,<br>
Will this finally cause her to change her ways?</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>Now her goose is cooked for good<br>
And Grandpa has flipped his wig<br>
We'll be counting all those days<br>
While Grandma serves her time locked in a brig</p>
<p>I warned all my friends and neighbors,<br>
Better watch out for your lives!<br>
They should never give a license<br>
To an old woman who drinks a lot and drives!</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>Sing it, Grandpa!</p>

<p>'Twas the Night After Christmas<br>
By Jeff Foxworthy</p>
<p>'Twas the night after Christmas and all through the trailer,<br>
the beer had gone flat and the pizza was staler.<br>
The tube socks hung empty, no candies or toys,<br>
and I was camped out on my old Lay-Z-Boy.<br>
The kids they weren't talking to me or my wife,<br>
the worst Christmas they said they had had in their lives.<br>
My wife couldn't argue and neither could I,<br>
so I watched TV and my wife, she just cried.</p>
<p>When out in the yard the dog started barkin',<br>
I stood up and looked and I saw Sheriff Larkin.<br>
He yelled, &quot;Roy I am sworn to uphold the laws<br>
and I got a complaint here from a feller named Claus.&quot;<br>
I said, &quot;Claus, I don't know nobody named Claus,<br>
and you ain't taking me in without probable cause.&quot;<br>
Then the Sheriff he said, &quot;The man was shot at last night.&quot;<br>
I said, &quot;That might have been me, just what's he look like?&quot;<br>
The Sheriff replied, &quot;He's a jolly old feller, with a big beer gut belly,<br>
that shakes when he laughs like a bowl full of jelly.<br>
He sports a long beard, and a nose like a cherry.&quot;<br>
I said, &quot;Sheriff that sounds like my wife's sister Sherri.&quot;<br>
&quot;It's no time for jokes Roy&quot; the Sheriff he said.<br>
&quot;The man I'm describing is dressed all in red.<br>
I'm here for the truth now, it's time to come clean.<br>
Tell me what you've done, tell me what you've seen.&quot;<br>
Well I started to lie then I thought what the hell,<br>
it wouldn't have been the first time that I've spent New Years in jail.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Sheriff it happened last night about ten,<br>
and I thought that my wife had been drinking again.&quot;<br>
When she walked in from work she was as white as a ghost.<br>
I thought maybe she had seen one of them UFO's.<br>
But she said that a bunch of deer had just flown over her head,<br>
and stopped on the roof of our good neighbour Red.<br>
Well I ran outside to look and the sight made me shudder,<br>
a freezer full of venison standing right on Red's gutter.<br>
Well my hands were a shakin' as I grabbed my gun,<br>
when outta Red's chimney this feller did run.<br>
And slung on his back was this bag over flowin'.<br>
I thought he'd stolen Red's stuff while old Red was out bowling'.<br>
So I yelled, &quot;Drop fat boy, hands in the air!&quot;<br>
But he went about his business like he hadn't a care.<br>
So I popped a warning shot over his head.<br>
Well he dropped that bag and he jumped in that sled.<br>
And as he flew off I heard him extort,<br>
&quot;That's assault with intent Roy, I'll see ya in court.&quot;</p>

<p>MICROSOFT CHRISTMAS</p>
<p>Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br>
Not a creature was stirring, except Papa's mouse.<br>
The computer was humming, the icons were hopping,<br>
As Papa did last-minute Internet shopping.</p>
<p>The stockings were hung by the modem with care<br>
In hope that St. Nicholas would bring new software.<br>
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br>
While visions of computer games danced in their heads.</p>
<p>Page Maker for Billy, and Quicken for Dan,<br>
And Carmen Sandiego for Pamela Ann.<br>
The letters to Santa had been sent out by Mom,<br>
To santaclaus@toyshop.northpole.com<br>
Which has now been re-routed to Washington State<br>
Because Santa's workshop has been bought by Bill Gates.</p>
<p>All the elves and reindeer have had to skedaddle<br>
To flashy new quarters in suburban Seattle.<br>
After centuries of a life that was simple and spare,<br>
St. Nicholas is suddenly a new billionaire,</p>
<p>With a shiny red Porsche in the place of his sleigh,<br>
And a house on Lake Washington that's just down the way<br>
&gt;From where Bill has his mansion. The old fellow preens<br>
In black Gucci boots and red Calvin Klein jeans.</p>
<p>The elves have stock options and desks with a view,<br>
Where they write computer code for Johnny and Sue.<br>
No more dolls or tin soldiers or little toy drums<br>
Will be under the tree, only compact disk ROMS<br>
With the Microsoft label. And don't you be late,<br>
&gt;From now on Christmas runs only on Win98.</p>
<p>More rapid than eagles the competitors came,<br>
And Bill whistled, and shouted, and called them by name.<br>
&quot;Now, ADOBE! Now, CLARIS! Now, INTUIT! too,<br>
Now, APPLE! and NETSCAPE! you are all of you through,<br>
It is Microsoft's SANTA that the kids can't resist,<br>
It's the ultimate software with a traditional twist.</p>
<p>Recommended by no less than the jolly old elf,<br>
And on the package, a picture of Santa himself.<br>
Get 'em young, keep 'em long, is Microsoft's scheme,<br>
And a merger with Santa is a marketer's dream.<br>
To the top of the NASDAQ! to the top of the Dow!<br>
Now dash away! dash away! dash away - wow!&quot;</p>
<p>And Mama in her 'kerchief and I in my cap,<br>
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,<br>
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br>
The whir and the hum of our satellite platter,<br>
As it turned toward that new Christmas star in the sky,<br>
The SANTALITE owned by the Microsoft guy.</p>
<p>As I sprang from my bed and was turning around,<br>
My computer turned on with a Jingle-Bells sound.<br>
And there on the screen was a smiling Bill Gates<br>
Next to jolly old Santa, two arm-in-arm mates.<br>
And I heard them exclaim in voices so bright,<br>
Have a MICROSOFT CHRISTMAS, and TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>The Night before Christmas... Biker Style</b></p>
<p>&quot;Twas the night before Christmas, and all round the pad,<br>
there was nada happenin', and that's nowhere, Dad.<br>
The stove was dressed out in that stocking routine,<br>
In hopes that the Fat Boy would soon make the scene.<br>
With our bellies all stuffed full of tacos and beer,<br>
Me and the bride hit the couch for some cheer.<br>
When out in the yard there arose such a racket,<br>
I ran for the door pulling on my old jacket.<br>
I saw this old geezer on a '57 Pan,<br>
Wearin' boots and black leather, a real biker man.<br>
His eyes how they twinkled under eyebrows so thick,<br>
I knew right away that this dude was Saint Nick.<br>
&quot;'Scuse me, Brother,&quot; his voice how it rumbled down low,<br>
&quot;Have you got some spare wrenches? My scooter won't go.&quot;<br>
&quot;I was flyin' along when she started to get hot,<br>
Then she sputtered and coughed, and died on the spot.&quot;<br>
That bike was all covered with stuffed leather bags<br>
holding brightly wrapped presents with ribbons and tags.<br>
Saint Nick he was frantic, his face wore a frown.<br>
&quot;The children are waiting. I can't let them down.&quot;<br>
I said, &quot;Wheel it in, Man! We'll get that Pan tickin'<br>
&quot;We've got leftover tacos, if you don't mind chicken.&quot;<br>
&quot;If we can't get it running in an hour or so,<br>
You can borrow MY bike -- just load it and go.&quot;<br>
So we pushed it on in and unhitched the load,<br>
I could fix what was busted and he'd be back on the road.<br>
As I puzzled and muttered over that righteous ride,<br>
He scuffed on the doormat and went on inside.<br>
He was back in a flash, tacos piled on a plate<br>
And a glass of skim milk that he sipped as he ate.<br>
&quot;It started to clatter,&quot; he said round a bite,<br>
&quot;It started to miss, then just quit outright&quot;<br>
&quot;It's just been rebuilt from the frame up this year,<br>
But I guess it's a good thing that I broke down here.<br>
From the looks of the sleds that're lined up out back,<br>
You're a man with the skill to put me back on track.&quot;<br>
&quot;You're good to go now,&quot; I said, wiping my hands,<br>
&quot;It was a quick fix, you can get on with your plans.<br>
&quot;The coil wire got snagged and pulled off, don't you see,<br>
So when you get on, be careful with your knee.&quot;<br>
We put the bags on and he zipped up his jacket,<br>
Then he kicked it to life with rumble - not racket.<br>
He settled his cap and said, &quot;Say, would you mind --<br>
If I road-test this pig to make sure that she's fine?'<br>
Flames shot from the pipes as he sped down the street,<br>
Then back by he came and that bike sounded sweet.<br>
He pulled up the bars on that Pan hung with sacks,<br>
And that bike hit the roof like it was running on tracks.<br>
I couldn't help staring as he shifted the tranny,<br>
But I had to go in -- I was freezing my fanny.<br>
When down through the chimney he fell with a crash,<br>
And out of the woodstove he came dragging his stash.<br>
With a twinkling eye, he passed out the loot,<br>
A new jacket for her and some parts for my scoot.<br>
He patted her ass and then shook my hand,<br>
Spun on his heel and up the stovepipe he ran.<br>
From up on the roof came a great peal of thunder,<br>
As that mighty V-twin tore the silence asunder.<br>
As he roared into the night, he waved and he cried,<br>
&quot;Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good ride.&quot;</p>

Ate his mousey intestines<br>
And chewed up his heart.</p>

He stopped daintily lickng<br>
the blood from his claws.</p>
<p>&quot;Must be Santa&quot; thought Kitty<br>

'Cuz nobody else climbs down<br>

<p>Indeed it was ol' Santa,<br>
so jolly and fat<br>
With a load of presents<br>

 &quot;In honor of this holy season,&quot; Saint Peter said, &quot;YOU MUST each possess<br>
something that symbolizes Christmas to get into heaven.&quot;<br>
 The first man fumbled through his pockets and he pulled out a lighter.<br>
He flicked it on.  It represents a candle, he said.<br>
 You may pass through the pearly gates Saint Peter said.<br>
 The second man reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys.  He shook them<br>
and said, &quot;They're bells.&quot; Saint Peter said you may pass through the pearly gates.<br>
 The third man started searching desperately through his pockets and finally<br>
pulled out a pair of women's panties.  St. Peter looked at the man with a raised<br>
eyebrow and asked, &quot;And just what do those symbolize?&quot;<br>
 The man replied, &quot;They're Carols.</p>

Theory's worse,<br>
Your Prof's on holidays<br>
You just want to chuck it all, and get the hell away.</p>
<p>Working overtime, eighteen hour days,<br>
For the last three months, you've been in a haze.<br>
Latex and Troff, you see them in your dreams<br>
You think you will die<br>

Said you must submit<br>
It's enough to give you hives, and to vomit.</p>
<p>Equations to typeset, forty pages more,<br>
Oh what fun it is, when E-Q-N aborts.<br>
All of your class mates, are laughing in your face,<br>
But then again next term,<br>
It will be their turn, Oh!</p>

<p>This is just a little something that someone I know composed last year<br>
To the best of my knowledge it has never before appeared on the net.</p>
<p><b>The Night Before Christmas</b></p>
<p>Twas the night befor Christmas, and God it was neat.<br>
The kids were both gone, and my wife was in heat.</p>
<p>The doors were all bolted, the phone off the hook,<br>
It was time for some nooky, by hook or by crook.</p>
<p>Momma in her teddy and I in the nude,<br>
Had just hit the bedroom and reached for the lube.</p>
<p>When out on the lawn there arose such a cry,<br>
That I lost my boner, and momma went dry.</p>
<p>Up to the window I sprang like an elf,<br>
Tore back the shade while she played with herself.</p>
<p>The moon on the crest of the snowman we'd built,<br>
Showed a broom up his ass, clean up to the hilt.</p>
<p>When what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
But a rusty old sleigh and eight mangey reindeer.</p>
<p>With a fat little driver, half out of the sled,<br>
A sock in his ear and a bra on his head.</p>
<p>Sure as I'm speaking, he was high as a kite,<br>
And he yelled to his team, but it didn't sound right.</p>
<p>Woa Shithead, woa Asshole, woa Stupid, woa Putz,<br>
Either slow down this rig or I'll cut off your nuts.</p>
<p>Look out for the lamp post, and don't hit the tree,<br>
Quit shaking the sleigh, 'cause I gotta go pee.</p>
<p>They cleared the old lamp post, the tree got a rub,<br>
Just as Santa leaned out and threw up on my shrub.</p>
<p>And then from the roof we heard such a clatter,<br>
As each little reindeer now emptied his bladder.</p>
<p>I was donning my jockies, to cover my ass,<br>
When down the chimney Santa came with a crash.</p>
<p>His suit was all smelly with perfume galore,<br>
He looked like a bum and he smelled like a whore.</p>
<p>&quot;That was some brothel,&quot; he said with a smile,<br>
&quot;The reindeer are pooped, and I'll just stay awhile&quot;</p>
<p>He walked to the kitchen for himself poured a drink,<br>
Then whipped out his pecker and pissed in the sink.</p>
<p>I started to laugh, my wife smiled with glee,<br>
The old boy was hung nearly down to his knee.</p>
<p>Back in the den, Santa reached in his sack,<br>
But his toys were all gone, and some new things were packed.</p>
<p>The first thing he found was a pair of false tits,<br>
The next was a handgun with a penis that spits.</p>
<p>A box filled with condoms was Santa's next find,<br>
And six pair of panties, the edible kind.</p>
<p>A bra without nipples, a penis extension,<br>
And several more things I shouldn't even mention.</p>
<p>A fuck ring, a G-string, and all types of oil,<br>
And a dildo so long that it lay in a coil.</p>
<p>&quot;This stuff ain't for kids, Mrs. Santa will shit,<br>
So I'll leave 'em here, and then I'll just split.&quot;</p>
<p>He filled every stocking and then took his leave,<br>
With one tiny butt plug stuck under his sleeve.</p>
<p>He sprang to his sleigh, but his feet were like lead,<br>
Thus he fell on his ass and broke wind instead.</p>
<p>In time he was seated, took reigns of his hitch,<br>
Saying, &quot;Take me home, Rudolf. This night's been a bitch!&quot;</p>
<p>The sleigh was near gone when we heard Santa shout,<br>
&quot;The best thing about pussy is you can't wear it out!!&quot;</p>
<p>Brought to you by Swaycone. Merry Christmas everyone!</p>

<p><b>&quot;Slave Caravan&quot;</b></p>
<p>Slave chains ring,<br>
Are you listening?<br>
In the air,<br>
Whips are whistling.<br>
A beautiful sight;<br>
A flogging tonight.<br>
Travelling with the slave caravan.</p>
<p>Gone away<br>
Is their freedom.<br>
Sell 'em to<br>
Whoever needs 'em.<br>
A beautiful sight;<br>
A flogging tonight.<br>
Travelling with the slave caravan.</p>
<p>In the meadow we can raze a village.<br>
We can burn it right down to the ground!<br>
And then we will rape and we will pillage,<br>
Or maybe it's the other way around.</p>
<p>Late at night,<br>
We'll conspire.<br>
As we sit,<br>
By the fire.<br>
And face unafraid,<br>
The foes that we made,<br>
Travelling with the slave caravan.</p>
<p><b>&quot;The Restroom Door Said 'Gentlemen'&quot;</b></p>
<p>The restroom door said 'Gentlemen'<br>
So I just walked inside.<br>
I took two steps and realized<br>
I'd been taken for a ride.<br>
I heard high voices,<br>
Turned and found the place was occupied<br>
By three nuns,two old ladies and a nurse.<br>
What could be worse<br>
Than three nuns, two old ladies and a nurse?</p>
<p>The restroom door said 'Gentlemen'<br>
It must have been a gag.<br>
As soon as I walked in<br>
I ran into some old hag.<br>
She sprayed me with a can of mace<br>
And hit me with her bag.<br>
It just wasn't turning out oto be my day.<br>
What can I say?<br>
It just wasn't turning out to be my day!</p>
<p>The restroom dood said 'Gentlemen'<br>
And I would like to find<br>
The crummy little creep<br>
who had the nerve to switch the sign.<br>
'Cause I've got two black eyes<br>
And one high heel up my behind.<br>
Now I'll never sit in comfort or joy.<br>
Boy oh boy!<br>
Now I'll never sit in comfort or joy.</p>

 Oh what fun<br>
 It is to ride<br>
 In a beat-up Chevrolet!</p>
<p> Dashing through the snow<br>

 sliding all the way.<br>
 I need new piston rings.<br>
 I need some new snow tires.<br>
 My car is held together<br>

<p> Rust and smoke, the heater's broke,<br>
 the door just blew away.<br>
 I light a match to see the dash<br>
 and then I start to pray.<br>
 The frame is bent, the muffler went,<br>
 the radio it's ok.<br>
 Oh what fun it is to drive<br>
 this rusty Chevrolet.</p>
<p> I went to the IGA<br>
 to get some Christmas cheer.<br>
 I just passed up my left front tire<br>
 and its getting hard to steer.<br>
 Skidding down the highway<br>
 right past the Negaunee cops.<br>
 I had to drag my swampers<br>
 to get the car to stop.</p>
<p> Bouncing through the snowdrifts<br>
 in a big blue cloud of smoke,<br>
 people laugh as I drive by.<br>
 I wonder what's the joke.<br>
 I got to get to shopko<br>
 to pick up the layaway<br>
 cause Santa Claus is coming soon<br>
 in his big old rusty sleigh.</p>

<p>The three wise men arrived to visit the child lying in the manger.  One of the<br>
wise men was exceptionally tall, and bumped his head on the low doorway as he<br>
entered the stable.  &quot;Jesus Christ!&quot; he shouted.  Joseph said, &quot;Write that down,<br>
Mary; it's better than Clyde!&quot;</p>
<p>During the recent Karpov-Kasparov world chess championships they came to an<br>
adjournment and left for their hotel.  In the lobby of the hotel several chess<br>
enthusiasts could be heard bragging, &quot;I could beat Karpov with no problem&quot;.  &quot;Oh<br>
yeah, I could beat both of them at the same time.&quot; &quot;That's nothing, I could beat<br>
both of them blindfolded!&quot;  Finally, the hotel manager had had enough and threw<br>
them all out of the hotel.  But why?&quot; a bystander asked.  &quot;Because,&quot; the manager<br>
replied &quot;I hate... &quot;chess nuts boasting by an open foyer!&quot;</p>
<p> A Sunday School teacher of pre-schoolers was concerned that his students<br>
might be a little confused about Jesus Christ because of the Christmas season<br>
emphasis on His birth.  He wanted to make sure they understood that the birth of<br>
Jesus occurred a long time ago, that He grew up, etc.  So he asked his class,<br>
&quot;Where is Jesus today?&quot;<br>
 Steven raised his hand and said, &quot;He's in heaven.&quot;<br>
 Mary was called on and answered, &quot;He's in my heart.&quot;<br>
 Little Johnny, waving his hand furiously, blurted out, &quot;I know! I know!<br>
He's in our bathroom!!!&quot;<br>
 The whole class got very quiet, looked at the teacher, and waited for a<br>
response.  The teacher was completely at a loss for a few very long seconds.<br>
He finally gathered his wits and asked Little Johnny how he knew this.<br>
 And Little Johnny said, &quot;Well...every morning, my father gets up, bangs on<br>
the bathroom door, and yells 'Jesus Christ, are you still in there?'!&quot;</p>
<p> Santa Claus makes his way down the chimney and is met by a lovely young woman<br>
in a robe.  She says &quot;Santa, how about giving me a special present. I know you'd<br>
like to come into my bedroom.&quot;<br>
 Santa responds &quot;Ho!  Ho!  Ho!  Gotta go.  Gotta go.  Gotta deliver all these<br>
toys to the children you know.&quot;<br>
 The lovely young thing peels off her robe, revealing a skimpy negligee.<br>
Santa looks up from his sack of gifts, and she says &quot;I've got something special<br>
for you Santa.  Can't you stay for just a little while?  I know you want me.<br>
Let me make this Christmas eve unforgettable.&quot;<br>
 Santa responds &quot;Ho!  Ho!  Ho! Gotta go.  Gotta go.  Gotta deliver all these<br>
toys to the children you know.&quot;<br>
 Not to be denied, she strips off the negligee, revealing her naughty bits,<br>
and they were quite nice naughty bits, I might add.  And she says &quot;Santa, this<br>
is your last chance.  This body is your gift.&quot;<br>
 Santa responds &quot;Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Gotta stay.  Gotta Stay.  Can't get up the<br>
chimney with my dick this way!&quot;</p>
<p> As the Christmas season draws nigh, foretelling the end of over a full month<br>
of Commercial Christmas, there is a special urgency in the spirits of children<br>
as they visit toy stores and toy departments all over the country.  It was with<br>
particular urgency that little Wilbert dragged his mother to the toy department<br>
in a big Los Angeles department store.<br>
 Mother quickly steered Wilbert into the line of children waiting to talk to<br>
Santa, but Wilbert was far more interested in the hobby horse.  As soon as his<br>
mother relaxed her vigilance for a moment, Wilbert vanished from the Santa Queue<br>
and began rocking back and forth on the hobby horse.  His mother noticed his<br>
absence, and after a quick, frantic search, spotted him on the horse.  She let<br>
him rock for a few minutes, then told him it was time to get off. Wilbert<br>
ignored her.  She began to beg; Wilbert paid no attention.  She began to make<br>
promises of sugarplums, etc., if only Wilbert would get off the hobby horse.  He<br>
stuck his nasty little tongue out at her.<br>
 Then Santa himself, who had been watching this little family drama out of the<br>
corner of his eye, stepped over and said to Wilbert's mother, &quot;Perhaps I can<br>
persuade your son to cooperate.&quot;<br>
 &quot;I doubt that,&quot; said the mother, &quot;but you're welcome to try.&quot;<br>
 Santa, with a big smile, whispered quietly into Wilbert's ear.  Wilbert's<br>
eyes grew very large, he quickly slid off the horse and took his mother's hand.<br>
Together, with no fuss, they left the store.  As they drove home, Mama asked<br>
Wilbert what Santa had whispered to him.  Wilbert was silent.  Mama began<br>
offering bribes (toys and German Chocolate cake) if Wilbert would only tell Mama<br>
what Santa's words were.  Wilbert turned pale and wouldn't utter a word.  What<br>
had Santa said?  Wilbert's mother was determined to find out.  She had never<br>
been able to get the kid to obey that easily, and decided it was worth a great<br>
deal of effort on her part to discover what magic Santa Claus had used on<br>
Wilbert.  She continued to bribe him with a soft voice and much cajolery, and<br>
Wilbert's stubborn streak finally faded.  What did Santa say?<br>
  Wilbert now answered: &quot;He said, 'Listen, you little son of a bitch, if you<br>
don't climb your ass the hell down off that horse right this second, I'm going<br>
to kick the living piss out of you!' &quot;</p>

<p><b>Why The Little Angel Sits On Top Of The Christmas Tree...</b></p>
<p>   On Christmas Eve, Santa Claus was getting ready for his annual trip.  As he<br>
pulled his favorite pair of red pants on, they ripped.  So, he had to take them<br>
off and put on another pair, which was a bit too tight.  He then went to check<br>
on the rest of the preparations.  The elves were on strike.  The reindeer had<br>
shin-splints; the vet bill was enormous.  At this point, Santa was bummed.<br>
   He went into the kitchen to take a calming drink, and the bottle was empty.<br>
Now he was really mad.<br>
   All of sudden, there was a knock at the door.  Santa, in his angry state,<br>
ignored it.  There was another knock.  Santa was in no mood for all of this.<br>
When the knock came again, Santa, filled with rage, threw open the door.<br>
   Standing there was a little angel who said, &quot;Hi Santa!  What do you want me<br>
to do with this Christmas tree?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Why The Little Angel Sits On Top Of The Christmas Tree... (alternate version)</b></p>
<p> Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting ready for his annual<br>
trip ... but there were problems everywhere.<br>
 Four of his elves were sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as<br>
fast as the regular ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being<br>
behind schedule.<br>
 Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit.  This stressed<br>
Santa even more.  When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of<br>
them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven<br>
knows where.  More Stress. Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the<br>
boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys.<br>
So, frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of<br>
whiskey.  When he went to the cupboard, he found the elves had hidden the liquor<br>
and there was nothing to drink.  In his frustration, he dropped the coffee pot<br>
and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the he kitchen floor.<br>
 He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it from which<br>
it was made.<br>
 Just then the doorbell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door.<br>
He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree.<br>
The angel said: &quot;Where would you like to put this tree Santa?&quot;<br>
 And that my friends, is how the little angel came to be on top of the<br>
Christmas tree.</p>

<p> Two dudes take the same train every day.<br>
 Dude 1, the smart one, says to dude 2, the dumb one: &quot;Hey, did you get the greetz from Claus?&quot;<br>
 Dude 2: &quot;Who's Claus?&quot;<br>
 Dude 1: &quot;Well, you know Santa claus!&quot;<br>
 Dude 2 is a little angry, but doesn't know what to say.<br>
 The next day, dude 1 makes the same joke to him and he really get's pissed.<br>
 That evening, he tells his wife, &quot;Every day, there is a smart dude on the<br>
train telling me that I got the greetz from a certain Claus.  I dunno what Claus<br>
he's talking about and he always tells me it's Santa!&quot;<br>
 His wife, a brunette, tells him he has to reverse the thread by telling the<br>
smart dude he gets the greetz from a certain Lilly...Picca Lilly!&quot;<br>
 &quot;Aha!' says the dumb dude and with a huge smile.  He takes the train next moring.<br>
 When he sees the smart dude, he tells him he gets the greetz from Lilly'.<br>
 Dude 1: &quot;Ooooohh!!!  Picca Lilly!&quot;<br>
 Dude 2: &quot;Huh?  How do you know her?&quot;<br>
 Dude 1: &quot;Well, Claus introduced me.&quot;<br>
 Dude 2: &quot;Claus?  Who's Claus?&quot;<br>
 Dude 1: &quot;Santa Claus!&quot;</p>

<p>One evening, in a busy lounge in the deep south, a reindeer walked in the door,<br>
bellied up to the bar and ordered a martini.  Without batting an eye, the<br>
bartender mixed and poured the drink, set it in front of the reindeer, and<br>
accepted the twenty-dollar bill from the reindeer's hoof.  As he handed the<br>
reindeer some coins in change, he said &quot;You know, I think you're the first<br>
reindeer I've ever seen in here.&quot;  The reindeer looked hard at the hoofful of<br>
change and said &quot;Hmmmpf.  Let me tell you something, buddy. At these fuckin'<br>
prices, I'm the _last_ reindeer you'll see in here.&quot;</p>

<p>Santa: (touching the little boy on the nose with his finger)<br>
I'll bet you'd like a puppy for Christmas.<br>
Boy: (Shakes his head, &quot;No&quot;)<br>
Santa: (touching the little boy on the nose with his finger again)<br>
Well, then I'll bet you'd like a kitten for Christmas.<br>
Boy: (again shakes his head, &quot;No&quot;)<br>
Santa: Then what would you like for Christmas, little boy?<br>
Boy: I want some pussy!!!<br>
Santa: (Startled and almost speechless)  Well, I don't have any of of that!?!?<br>
Boy: (Touching Saint Nick on nose)  Yes you do, because I can smell it on your finger!</p>

   Yes, Virginia, it does compile cleanly.
   An appropriate program for December 25th, this consists primarily of calls
   to main() combined by a lot of the ternary conditional (?:) operators.
   Note: I have made a minor correction (for spelling) to line 48, where I
   added a missing comma at column 59. I also added the #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

<p>Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer</p>
<p>- Irish Rovers (1986?)</p>
<p>Grandma got run over by a reindeer<br>
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.<br>
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,<br>
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.</p>
<p>She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog,<br>
And we'd begged her not to go.<br>
But she forgot her medication,<br>
So she stumbled out the door into the snow.</p>
<p>When we found her Christmas mornin',<br>
At the scene of the attack.<br>
There were hoofprints on her forehead,<br>
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back.</p>
<p>Grandma go run over by a reindeer,<br>
Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve.<br>
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,<br>
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.</p>
<p>Now were all so proud of Grandpa,<br>
He's been takin' this so well.<br>
See him in there watchin' football,<br>
Drinkin' beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle.</p>
<p>It's not Christmas without Grandma.<br>
All the family's dressed in black.<br>
And we just can't help but wonder:<br>
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?<br>
(Send them back!)</p>
<p>Grandma got run over by a reindeer,<br>
Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve.<br>
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,<br>
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.</p>
<p>Now the goose is on the table<br>
And the pudding made of pig.<br>
And a blue and silver candle,<br>
That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig.</p>
<p>I've warned all my friends and neighbors.<br>
&quot;Better watch out for yourselves.&quot;<br>
They should never give a license,<br>
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves.</p>
<p>Grandma got run over by a reindeer,<br>
Walkin' home from our house, Christmas eve.<br>
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,<br>

<p>New Kids Got Run Over By A Reindeer</p>

<p>New kids got run over by a reindeer<br>
All the little children are in shock.<br>
No more loud annoying high falsettos-oh-ohhh<br>
Now there's no more new kids on the block.</p>
<p>They were singing their new hit song:<br>
&quot;Cover Girls With The Right Stuff&quot;<br>
Now they're trophies for a reindeer,<br>
Mounted on his mantle, hanging tough.</p>
<p>Many times I was mistaken,<br>
When I went to see their show.<br>
Was it Danny, Donny, Joe, John, Jordon,<br>
Or Larry, Curly, Shemp and Moe-oh-oh-oh-ohh?</p>
<p>New kids got run over by a reindeer.<br>
All the little children are in shock.<br>
No more loud annoying high falsettos-oh-ohh<br>
Now there's no more new kids on the block.</p>
<p>Now the new kid fans are crying,<br>
And they say this really sucks!<br>
But don't blame it on the reindeer,<br>
Cause I'm the one who gave him fifty bucks.</p>
<p>New kids got run over by a reindeer.<br>
No more little brats for me to mock.<br>
No more pre-pubescent high falsettos-oh-ohh<br>
Now there's no more new kids on the block.</p>

<p>History Of Santa Claus: The Untold Story</p>
<p>1689: A Spanish-German explorer, Santa Klaus, discovers the North Pole, and<br>
      establishes a small base camp.</p>
<p>1691: Because of harsh and meager living conditions, Klaus' crew abandons him.</p>
<p>1692: Klaus is rescued by the Viking ship Hvorfor.  He returns to Europe,<br>
      bringing some items with him from the North Pole.  He finds he's able to<br>
      sell them quite easily, making a small profit.</p>
<p>1703: Klaus saves up enough money to buy a small ship and crew, and returns to<br>
      the North Pole.  Upon arriving, he finds his base camp, half-buried but<br>
      still intact.</p>
<p>1704: Klaus returns to Europe with a shipload of North Pole artifacts, and is<br>
      successful in selling them.  He makes enough profit to increase his crew,<br>
      and buys building materials to expand his polar base.</p>
<p>1705: Klaus returns again to the North Pole, and builds quarters for him and his<br>
      crew, and sets up the Polar Exports Company.</p>
<p>1716: After six shiploads of exports, the European market is flooded with polar<br>
      artifacts, including the phony ones making charlatans rich.  Seeing this<br>
      decline, Klaus decides to invest his money by starting a toy company in<br>
      his native Germany.</p>
<p>1720: Klaus Toys becomes the largest toy company in Germany, but only because of<br>
      Klaus' underhanded business dealings.  (It was also rumored that Klaus was<br>
      dealing with enemy countries as well)  Competitors urged government<br>
      officials to begin an investigation.</p>
<p>1721: Enough proof is found, and charges are drawn up against the Klaus Toys<br>
      Company.  Klaus himself refuses to release his records.</p>
<p>1722: The German Supreme Court finds Klaus guilty of tax evasion and of treason.<br>
      When news of this breaks, Klaus' employees all turn against him and his<br>
      company.</p>
<p>1723: Klaus is exiled to Sicily, and shortly before leaving, he absconds with<br>
      all the company's funds.  Klaus spends much of this year changing his<br>
      identity to evade authorities; to further mask his questionable past, he<br>
      changes his name now to 'Claus'.</p>
<p>1724: A search party is sent to the Mediterranean to recover the funds; however,<br>
      Claus hears of this ahead of time and he and his Sicilian wife flee for<br>
      their lives.  (Some say he went into Northern Africa, but it's generally<br>
      assumed that this was only a ruse to lure the searchers off course.  He's<br>
      believed to have returned to his North Pole base)</p>
<p>1725: Claus II is born en route to the North Pole.</p>
<p>1725-1734: The Claus' lay low at the North Pole.  Claus teaches his son the arts<br>
      of toymaking and business dealings.</p>
<p>1735: Rumor has it that Claus has hired Scandinavian builders to build a castle<br>
      for him at the North Pole, making use of almost half of the company funds.</p>
<p>1739: The castle is finished, and is one of the largest in the world.  Claus II<br>
      reaches his fifteenth birthday, and in the same year, Claus' wife dies,<br>
      accidentally falling from a balcony in one of the castle's great halls.</p>
<p>1740: Claus, mourning his wife, becomes increasingly ill.</p>
<p>1745: Santa Claus II becomes of age, and begins taking care of the castle and<br>
      of his sick father.</p>
<p>1747: Using the remaining company funds, Claus II builds a small city around<br>
      the castle to attract workers and craftsmen.</p>
<p>1748: Word of the North Pole settlement reaches Europe.  The Elves of Eastern<br>
      Europe, quickly becoming political outcasts and striving for a better<br>
      life, begin immigrating in waves to the North Pole.</p>
<p>1753: All the elves have left Eastern Europe and have become firmly established<br>
      at the North Pole.  Claus II begins his father's toy company once again,<br>
      with an estimated 30,000 elves employed. Claus I dies, at age 89.</p>
<p>1755: The North Pole officially becomes a nation, and Claus II and his wife take<br>
      the throne.  The toy business continues to flourish, and the elves enjoy<br>
      prosperity.  Claus III is born.</p>
<p>1757: The great stables are built, and scientists are secretly hired by Claus<br>
      II to begin an ambitious project, that of breeding and training reindeer<br>
      to fly.</p>
<p>1773: The flying reindeer are achieved and become Claus II and III's major form<br>
      of transportation.</p>
<p>1774: A mutant reindeer, named Rudolf, is born whose nose emits light.  He<br>
      becomes an outcast of the reindeer society, and is taken in by the Claus<br>
      government.  Claus II celebrates his 50th birthday, inviting several other<br>
      world leaders for a stay at his castle.  To impress them, he displays a<br>
      lavish show of wealth, all at the elves' expense.  He gives the other<br>
      leaders the impression of a dictatorship under the guise of royalty.  The<br>
      elves sense this, and the seeds of rebellion are planted.</p>
<p>1777: As conditions become increasingly strict, the elves begin to search for a<br>
      leader to lead their revolt.  Rudolf, still in favor of the Claus<br>
      government, sees their plight and begins thinking of ways to use it to his<br>
      advantage.</p>
<p>1784: On his 60th birthday, Claus II takes a sleigh ride down main street during<br>
      the Christmas day parade, and is assassinated by a radical faction of<br>
      elves.  Claus III, now 29, takes over immediately and puts martial law<br>
      into effect for the whole North Pole.  Civil war breaks out as Rudolf<br>
      leads the Elves in rebellion.</p>
<p>1785-1792: The Seven-year Strike happens.  The elves refuse to make toys, and<br>
      the Claus Toy Company nearly goes bankrupt, as the North Pole hits an<br>
      economic low.  Claus III, fearing for his life, becomes a prisoner of his<br>
      own castle.  Rudolf rises to the peak of his power, and sets himself as<br>
      leader of the elven community.</p>
<p>1796: Rudolf and his army unsuccessfully try to invade Norway. Over 10,000 elves<br>
      are killed.</p>
<p>1800: Inside the castle, unbeknownst to the elves, Claus IV is born.</p>
<p>1802: After a string of political blunders, Rudolf senses that he's quickly<br>
      losing favor with the elves.  Frosty the Snowman is built, brought to<br>
      life, and used as a political scapegoat.</p>
<p>1804: Frosty the Snowman is melted at a public execution, and the elves are<br>
      calmed of their unrest, for the moment.</p>
<p>1819-1826: After a long period of unrest, Rudolf is finally ousted, and Claus<br>
      III, aged 71, rightfully regains the throne.  Prince Claus IV is<br>
      introduced to the elves publicly for the first time.</p>
<p>1827-1841: The Renormalization years.  Claus III brings the near-bankrupt Claus<br>
      Toys Company out of dormancy and appoints his son as president.  In order<br>
      to clear their bad name and make up for their out-of-the-way location,<br>
      they decide to start the hugest advertising campaign ever. Each Christmas,<br>
      Claus IV will ride throughout the world, distributing free toys to<br>
      children everywhere.  The ad campaign becomes a hit, but remains very<br>
      costly.</p>
<p>1847: Claus III dies.</p>
<p>1851: As the annual ad campaign continues, deficits pile up, and the elves are<br>
      asked to work harder, longer hours and still take a pay cut. They start to<br>
      complain, but Claus assures them he'll do all he can to help them.  As a<br>
      sign of goodwill, Claus IV marries an Elven wife, strengthening the bonds<br>
      between the Claus family and the Elves.</p>
<p>1856: Claus V is born.  In order to celebrate, Claus IV decides to stay at home,<br>
      and so he suggests that department stores use costumed employees to<br>
      represent him.  They do, and it works out so well that he decides to do it<br>
      every year.</p>
<p>1857-1867: Claus V grows up, spending most of his time visiting with his elf<br>
      relatives and friends.  Claus IV, who spends most of his time building up<br>
      the company, doesn't seem to mind; in fact, he feels that it's good<br>
      publicity.</p>
<p>1871: Working conditions continue to worsen for the elves, and they try to<br>
      convince Claus V to overthrow his father and give the government back to<br>
      the elves.</p>
<p>1872: Claus V usurps his father's throne, sending him to live the remainder of<br>
      his life under guard in the castle's west wing.</p>
<p>1875: After reading the works of Karl Marx, Claus V chooses communism as the new<br>
      form of government for the North Pole.  Some elves protest this, but they<br>
      are successfully quieted.  (It's also because of communism that Santa<br>
      Claus' suit later changes from beige to red.)</p>
<p>1881: Claus IV dies in captivity, just as the new Government gets underway.  His<br>
      funeral isn't a large one.</p>
<p>1887: In order to keep up with growing populations, Claus Toys becomes<br>
      industrialized.  The elves learn the ways of mass production on the<br>
      assembly line.</p>
<p>1893: Another mutant reindeer is born, and is named Rudolf II in honor of the<br>
      first one, whom the communist government now honors for &quot;giving the<br>
      government back to the elves.&quot;</p>
<p>1900: Sigmund Freud's &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; is published.</p>
<p>1902: After he had been presumed dead for years, Frosty the Snowman is claimed<br>
      to have been sighted on several occasions.  Throughout the kingdom,<br>
      children claim that they all heard him say he'd be back again some day.</p>
<p>1906: Claus VI is born.  The Claus family celebrates, but the elves aren't the<br>
      least bit excited.</p>
<p>1909-1922: The toys distributed yearly begin to show signs of propaganda<br>
      influence.  Frosty the Snowman continues to appear occasionally, and Claus<br>
      V begins to grow uneasy, fearing some sort of hidden sabotage.</p>
<p>1925: Claus V dies, under mysterious circumstances.  He's found buried in the<br>
      snow in the castle garden, frozen solid.  Many think it is the work of<br>
      Frosty, but no one can prove it.</p>
<p>1926: Claus VI takes over, and immediately tightens up security.  He rules with<br>
      an iron hand, but a fair one.  Electric lights are installed in the<br>
      streets, and the castle and the town gets electricity.  The factories are<br>
      expanded, and the toys continue to be used as propaganda for the world.</p>
<p>1929: Angered by Claus' commercialization of Christmas, the Grinch attempts to<br>
      remove the material goods to show the true meaning of Christmas. He fails,<br>
      and later Claus commissions a cartoon, which warps the story so that the<br>
      Grinch is made out to be the villain.</p>
<p>1949: Claus VII is born.</p>
<p>1979: Claus VI dies of natural causes.</p>
<p>1933-1990: The North Pole remains stable, with everything running smoothly.<br>
      Across the Western world, a pattern starts to emerge and become noticed.<br>
      Children receive Claus' toys each Christmas, but as they grow older, their<br>
      parents throw them away.  Then, as the children grow into adults and have<br>
      children of their own, the toys start to surface again.  And so the cycle<br>
      goes on.</p>
<p>1991: First sightings of Anti-Claus.</p>
<p>1993: Anti-Claus is observed closely with telescopes, and photographed. His suit<br>
      is like that of Santa Claus, but with the reds and whites reversed.  He<br>
      carries a 3-ply Hefty bag full of gifts no one wants or needs. And instead<br>
      of using reindeer and a sleigh, he rides in a bathtub pulled by eight<br>
      flying cows.</p>
<p>1997: Anti-Claus is tracked by radar and found to live in an underground hideout<br>
      run by dwarves at the South Pole.</p>
<p>2002: Communism fails utterly at the North Pole resulting from the nature of the<br>
      elves.  Claus VII, flying clockwise around the earth making the Christmas<br>
      rounds, collides with Anti-Claus, who was flying counterclockwise.  A huge<br>
      explosion and blinding flash of light occurs, leading scientists to<br>
      believe that they annihilated each other.</p>
<p>2007: The North Pole becomes a democracy, run wholly by the elves. Christmas is<br>
      no longer commercialized or exploited. Happiness is finally achieved<br>
      throughout the kingdom.</p>
<p>2011: It's discovered that Claus VII didn't die in the explosion, but merely<br>
      made it appear so.  From there, he went to live in the Bahamas. He's later<br>
      found, dead of a heart attack, in a jacuzzi with two and a half dozen<br>
      nymphets.</p>

<p>Twas The Night Before Crisis</p>
<p>Twas the night before crisis,<br>
and all through the house,<br>
not a program was working,<br>
not even a browse.<br>
The programmers were wrung out,<br>
too mindless to care,<br>
knowing chances of turnover<br>
hadn't a prayer.<br>
The users were nestled<br>
all snug in their beds,<br>
while visions of inquires<br>
danced in their heads.<br>
When out in the lobby,<br>
there arose such a clatter,<br>
I sprang from my tube<br>
to see what was the matter.<br>
And what to my wondering<br>
eyes should appear,<br>

oblivious to fear.<br>
More rapid than eagles,<br>
his programs they came,<br>

and called them by name:<br>

On Add!<br>
On Inquiry<br>

On Batch Jobs!<br>
On Closing!<br>
On Function Complete!<br>
His eyes were glazed over,<br>
his fingers were lean,<br>
&gt;from weekends and nites<br>
in front of the screen.<br>
A wink of his eye<br>
and a twist of his head<br>
soon let me to know<br>
I had nothing to dread.<br>
He spoke not a word,<br>
but went straight to his work,<br>
turning specs into code,<br>
compiled without a quirk,<br>
and laying his finger<br>
on the lone &quot;Enter&quot; key,<br>
the system came up<br>
and it worked perfectly!<br>
The updates updated,<br>
the deleted deleted,<br>
the inquires inquired,<br>
and the closings completed.<br>
With nary an abend,<br>
he tested each bell,<br>
no a single core dump,<br>
all sure had gone well.<br>
The system was finished,<br>
the tests were concluded.<br>
The client's last changes<br>

<p>A Great Winged Beast<br>
had fallen from the sky.<br>
He laughed and he coughed<br>

<p><b>T'was The Night Before Christmas - Scientific Style</b></p>
<p>A Visit From St. Nicholas</p>
<p>Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period<br>
preceding the annual yuletide celebration,<br>
and throughout our place of residence,<br>
kinetic activity was not in evidence<br>
among possessors of this potential,<br>
including that species of domestic rodent<br>
known as Mus musculus.<br>
Hosiery was meticulously suspended<br>
from the forward edge of the<br>
wood burning caloric apparatus,<br>
persuant to our anticipatory pleasure<br>
regarding an imminent visitation<br>
from an eccentric philanthropist<br>
among whose folkloric appellations is<br>
the honorific title of St. Nicholas.</p>
<p>The prepubescent siblings,<br>
comfortably ensconced in their respective accommodations of repose,<br>
were experiencing subconscious visual hallucinations<br>
of variegated fruit confections<br>
moving rhythmically through their cerebrums.<br>
My conjugal partner and I,<br>
attired in our nocturnal head coverings,<br>
were about to take slumbrous advantage of the hibernal darkness<br>
when upon the avenaceous exterior portion<br>
of the grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance<br>
that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity<br>
from my place of repose for the purpose of<br>
ascertaining the precise source thereof.</p>
<p>Hastening to the casement,<br>
I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this fenestration,<br>
noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without,<br>
reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,<br>
might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself -<br>
thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold<br>
a miniature airborne runnered conveyance<br>
drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer,<br>
piloted by a minuscule aged chauffer so ebullient and numble<br>
that it became instantly apparent to me<br>
that he was indeed our anticipated caller.<br>
With his ungulate motive power travelling at<br>
what may possibly have been more vertiginous velocity<br>
that patriotic alar predators, he vociferated loudly,<br>
expelled breath musically through contracted labia,<br>
and addressed of the octet by his or her respective cognomen -<br>
&quot;Now Dasher, now Dancer...&quot; et al. -<br>
quiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode,<br>
through which structure I could readily distinguish<br>
the concatenations of each of the 32 cloven pedal extremities.</p>
<p>As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location,<br>
and was performing a 180-degree pivot,<br>
our distinguished visitant achieved -<br>
with utmost celerity and via a downward leap -<br>
entry by way of the smoke passage.<br>
He was clad entirely in animal pelts<br>
soiled by the ebon residue from  the oxidations<br>
of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof.<br>
His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed<br>
largely to the plethora of assorted playthings<br>
which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.</p>
<p>His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity,<br>
while his submaxillary dermal indentations<br>
gave every evidence of engaging amiability.<br>
The capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance<br>
were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers,<br>
the former approximating the coloration of Albion's floral emblem,<br>
the latter that of the Prunus avium, or sweet cherry.<br>
His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much<br>
as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment<br>
appeared like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.</p>
<p>Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece<br>
whose grey fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput,<br>
were suggestive of a decorative seasonal circlet of holly.<br>
His visage was wider than it was high,<br>
and when he waxed audibly mirthful,<br>
his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the manner<br>
of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container.<br>
He was, in short, neither more nor less than<br>
an obese, jocun, multigenarian gnome,<br>
the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome<br>
despite every effort to refrain from so being.<br>
By rapidly lowering and then raising one eyelid<br>
and rotating his head slightly to one side,<br>
he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless.</p>
<p>Without utterance and with dispatch,<br>
he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery<br>
with various of the aforementioned articles of merchandise<br>
extracted from his aforementioned previously<br>
dorsally transported cloth receptacle.<br>
Upon completion of this task,<br>
he executed an abrupt about-face,<br>
placed a single manual digit in lateral juxtaposition<br>
to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward<br>
in a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith affected his egress<br>
by renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage.<br>
He then propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance,<br>
directed a musical expulsion of air<br>
through his contracted oral sphincter<br>
to the antlered quadrupeds of burden,<br>
and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto observable<br>
chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed.<br>
But I overheard his parting exclamation, audible immediately<br>
prior to his  vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility:<br>
&quot;Ecstatic yuletide to the plenary constituency, and<br>
to that selfsame assemblage, my sincerest wishes<br>
for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly<br>
pleasurable period between sunset and dawn.&quot;</p>

As he drove out of sight,<br>
&quot;Screw you all and<br>
Make your own Christmas Night!&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>You can always tell the Christmas season is here when you start getting<br>
incredibly dense, tinfoil-and-ribbon-wrapped lumps in the mail.  Fruitcakes make<br>
ideal gifts because the Postal Service has been unable to find a way to damage<br>
them.  They last forever, largely because nobody ever eats them.  In fact, many<br>
smart people save the fruitcakes they receive and send them back to the original<br>
givers the next year; some fruitcakes have been passed back and forth for<br>
hundreds of years.</p>
<p>The easiest way to make a fruitcake is to buy a darkish cake, then pound some<br>
old, hard fruit into it with a mallet.  Be sure to wear safety glasses.  - Dave<br>

<p>Case Report: Unique Case of Aerial Sleigh-Borne Present-Deliverer's Syndrome<br>
Source: North Pole Journal of Medicine, vol 1 no.1, December 1993<br>
Author: Dr. Iman Elf, M.D.</p>
<p> On January 2, 1993, Mr. C, an obese, white caucasian male, who appeared<br>
approximately 65 years old, but who could not accurately state his age,<br>
presented to my family practice office with complaints of generalized aches and<br>
pains, sore red eyes, depression, and general malaise.  The patient's face was<br>
erythematic, and he was in mild respiratory distress, although his demeanor was<br>
jolly.  He attributed these symptoms to being &quot;not as young as I used to be, Ho!<br>
Ho! Ho!&quot;, but thought he should have them checked out.<br>
 The patient's occupation is delivering presents once a year, on December<br>
25th, to many people worldwide.  He flies in a sleigh pulled by eight reindeer,<br>
and gains access to homes via chimneys.  He has performed this work for as long<br>
as he can remember.<br>
 Upon examination and ascertaining Mr. C's medical history, I have discovered<br>
what I believe to be a unique and heretofore undescribed medical syndrome<br>
related to this man's occupation and lifestyle, named Aerial Sleigh-Borne<br>
Present-Deliverer's Syndrome, or ASBPDS for short.<br>
 Medical History:  Mr. C. admits to drinking only once a year, and only when<br>
someone puts rum in the eggnog left for him to consume during his working hours.<br>
However, I believe his bulbous nose and erythematic face may indicate long-term<br>
ethanol abuse.  He has smoked pipe tobacco for many years, although workplace<br>
regulations at the North Pole have forced him to cut back to one or two pipes<br>
per day for the last 5 years.  He has had no major illnesses or surgeries in the<br>
past.  He has no known allergies.  Travel history is extensive, as he visits<br>
nearly every location in the world annually.  He has had all his immunizations,<br>
including all available vaccines for tropical diseases.  He does little exercise<br>
and eats large meals with high sugar and cholesterol levels, and a high<br>
percentage of calories derived from fat (he subsists all year on food he<br>
collects on Dec. 25, which consists mainly of eggnog, Cola drinks, and cookies).<br>
Family history was unavailable, as the patient could not name any relatives.</p>
<p> Physical Examination and Review of Systems, With Social/Occupational<br>
Correlates:  The patient wears corrective lenses, and has 20/80 vision.  His<br>
conjunctivae were hyperalgesic and erythematous, and Fluorescein staining<br>
revealed numerous randomly occurring corneal abrasions.  This appears to be<br>
caused by dust, debris, and other particles which strike his eyes at high<br>
velocity during his flights.  He has headaches nearly every day, usually<br>
starting half way through the day, and worsened by stress.<br>
 He had extensive ecchymoses, abrasions, lacerations, and first-degree burns<br>
on his head, arms, legs, and back, which I believe to be caused mainly by trauma<br>
experienced during repeated chimney descents and falls from his sleigh.<br>
Collisions with birds during his flight, gunshot wounds (delivered by homeowners<br>
mistaking him for a burglar) and bites consistent with reindeer teeth may also<br>
have contributed to these wounds.  Patches of leukoderma and anesthesia on his<br>
nose, cheeks, penis, and distal digits are consistent with frostbite caused by<br>
periods of hypothermia during high-altitude flights.<br>
 He had a blood pressure of 150/95, a heart rate of 90 beats/minute, and a<br>
respiratory rate of 40.  He has had shortness of breath for several years, which<br>
worsens during exertion.  He has no evidence of acute cardiac or pulmonary<br>
failure, but it was my opinion that he is quite unfit due to his mainly<br>
sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits which, along with his stress,<br>
smoking, and male gender, place him at high risk for coronary heart disease,<br>
myocardial infarction, emphysema and other problems.  Blood tests subsequently<br>
revealed higher-than-normal CO levels, which I attribute to smoke inhalation<br>
during chimney descent into non-extinguished fireplaces.<br>
 He has experienced chronic back pain for several years.  A neurological<br>
examination was consistent with a mild herniation of his L4-L5 or L5-S1 disk,<br>
which probably resulted from carrying a heavy sack of toys, enduring bumpy<br>
sleigh rides, and his jarring feet-first falls to the bottom of chimneys.<br>
 Mr. C. had a swollen left scrotum, which, upon biopsy, was diagnosed as<br>
scrotal cancer, the likely etiology being the soot from chimneys.</p>
<p> Psychiatric Examination and Social/Occupational Correlates:  Mr. C's<br>
depression has been chronic for several years.  I do not believe it to be<br>
organic in nature--rather, he has a number of unresolved issues in his personal<br>
and professional life which cause him distress.<br>
 He exhibits long-term amnesia, and cannot recall any events more than 5 years<br>
ago.  This may be due to a repressed psychological trauma he experienced, head<br>
trauma, or, more likely, the mythical nature of his existence.<br>
 Although the patient has a jolly demeanor, he expresses profound unhappiness.<br>
He reports anger at not receiving royalties for the widespread commercial use of<br>
his likeness and name.  Although he reports satisfaction with the sex he has<br>
with his wife, I sense he may feel erotic impulses when children sit on his lap,<br>
and I worry he may have pedophillic tendencies.  This could be the subconscious<br>
reason he employs only vertically-challenged workers (&quot;elfs&quot;), but I believe his<br>
hiring practices are more likely a reaction formation due to body-image problems<br>
stemming from his obesity.  The patient feels annoyed and worried when he is<br>
told many people do not believe he exists, and I feel this may develop into a<br>
serious identity crisis if not dealt with.  He reports great stress over having<br>
to choose which gifts to give to children, and a feeling of guilt and inadequacy<br>
over the decisions he makes as to which children are &quot;naughty&quot; and &quot;nice&quot;.<br>
 Because he experiences total darkness lasting many months during winter at<br>
the North Pole, Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) may be a contributor to his<br>
depression.</p>
<p> Treatment and Counselling:  All Mr. C's wounds were cleaned and dressed, and<br>
he was prescribed an antibiotic ointment for his eyes.  A referral to a<br>
physiotherapist was made to ameliorate his disk problem.  On February 9, a<br>
bilateral orchidectomy was performed, and no further cancer has been detected as<br>
of this writing.  He was counselled to wash soot from his body regularly, to<br>
avoid lit-fire chimney descents where practicable, and to consider switching to<br>
a closed-sleigh, heated, pressurized sleigh.  He refused suggestions to add a<br>
helmet and protective accessories to his uniform.<br>
 He was put on a high-fibre, low cholesterol diet, and advised to reduce his<br>
smoking and drinking.  He has shown success with these lifestyle changes so far,<br>
although it remains to be seen whether he will be able to resist the treats left<br>
out for him next Christmas.<br>
 He visits a psychiatrist weekly, and reports doing &quot;Not too bad, Ho! Ho! Ho!&quot;.</p>
<p> Conclusions:  Physicians, when presented with aerial sleigh-borne present-<br>
deliverers exhibiting more than a few of these symptoms, should seriously<br>
consider ASBPDS as their differential diagnosis.  I encourage other physicians<br>
with access to patients working in allied professions (e.g. nightly Teeth-<br>
Purchasers or Annual Candied Egg Providers) to investigate whether analogous<br>
anatomical/ physiological/ psychological syndromes exist.  The happiness of<br>
children everywhere depend on effective management of these syndromes.</p>

<p><b>Is There A Santa Claus?</b></p>
<p> As a result of an overwhelming lack of requests, and with research help from<br>
that renown scientific journal SPY magazine (January, 1990) - I am pleased to<br>
present the annual scientific inquiry into Santa Claus.</p>
<p>1. No known species of reindeer can fly.  But there are 300,000 species of<br>
living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and<br>
germs, this does not completely rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has<br>
ever seen.<br>
2. There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in the world.  But since<br>
Santa doesn't (appear) to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist<br>
children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total - 378 million according<br>
to Population Reference Bureau.  At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per<br>
household, that's 91.8 million homes.  One presumes there's at least one good<br>
child in each.<br>
3. Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different<br>
time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west<br>
(which seems logical).  This works out to 822.6 visits per second.  This is to<br>
say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of<br>
a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the<br>
stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks<br>
have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to<br>
the next house.  Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly<br>
distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false but for the<br>
purposes of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking about .78 miles<br>
per household, a total trip of 75-1/2 million miles, not counting stops to do<br>
what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding, and etc.<br>
This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000 times<br>
the speed of sound.  For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle on<br>
earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a<br>
conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.<br>
4. The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element.  Assuming<br>
that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (2 pounds), the<br>
sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described<br>
as overweight.  On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds.<br>
Even granting that &quot;flying reindeer&quot; (see point #1) could pull TEN TIMES the<br>
normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine.  We need 214,200<br>
reindeer.  This increases the payload - not even counting the weight of the<br>
sleigh - to 353,430 tons.  Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight<br>
of the Queen Elizabeth.<br>
5. 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air<br>
resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as spacecraft<br>
re-entering the earth's atmosphere.  The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3<br>
*quintillion* joules of energy.  Per second.  Each.  In short, they will burst<br>
into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, and create<br>
deafening sonic booms in their wake.  The entire reindeer team will be vaporized<br>
within 4.26 thousandths of a second.  Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to<br>
centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times greater than gravity.  A 250-pound Santa<br>
(which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by<br>
4,315,015 pounds of force.<br>
 In conclusion - If Santa ever did deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's<br>
dead now.</p>
<p>Rebuttal: (Jim Mantle, Waterloo Maple Software)</p>
<p>Come on, ya gotta believe!  I mean, if you can handle flying furry animals, then<br>
it's only a small step to the rest.</p>
<p>For example;</p>
<p>1. As admitted, it is possible that a flying reindeer can be found.  I would<br>
agree that it would be quite an unusual find, but they might exist.<br>
2. You've relied on cascading assumptions.  For example, you have assumed a<br>
uniform distribution of children across homes.  Toronto/Yorkville, or<br>
Toronto/Cabbagetown, or other yuppie neighbourhoods, have probably less than<br>
the average (and don't forget the DINK and SINK homes (Double Income No Kids,<br>
Single Income No Kids)), while the families with 748 starving children that they<br>
keep showing on Vision TV while trying to pick my pocket would skew that 15% of<br>
homes down a few percent.<br>
3. You've also assumed that each home that has kids would have at least one<br>
good kid.  What if anti-selection applies, and homes with good kids tend to have<br>
more than their share of good kids, and other homes have nothing except<br>
terrorists in diapers?  Let's drop that number of homes down a few more percent.<br>
4. Santa would have to Fedex a number of packages ahead of time, since he<br>
would not be able to fly into Air Force Bases, or into tower-controlled areas<br>
near airports.  He's get shot at over certain sections of the Middle East, and<br>
the no-fly zones in Iraq, so he'd probably use DHL there.  Subtract some more<br>
homes.<br>
5. I just barely passed Physics and only read Stephen Hawking's book once,<br>
but I recall that there is some Einsteinian Theory that says time does strange<br>
things as you move faster.  In fact, when you go faster than the speed of light<br>
time runs backward, if you do a straight line projection, connect the dots and<br>
just ignore any singularity you might find right at the speed of light.  And<br>
don't say you can't go faster than the speed of light because I've seen it done<br>
on TV.  Jean-Luc doesn't have reindeer but he does have matter-antimatter warp<br>
engines and a holodeck and that's good enough for me.<br>
 So Santa could go faster than light, visit all the good children which are<br>
not uniformly distributed by either concentration in each home or by number of<br>
children per household, and get home before he left so he can digest all those<br>
stale cookies and warm milk yech.<br>
6. Aha, you say, Jean-Luc has matter-antimatter warp engines, Santa only has<br>
reindeer, where does he get the power to move that fast!<br>
 You calculated the answer!  The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3<br>
quintillion joules of energy.  Per second.  Each.  This is an ample supply of<br>
energy for the maneuvering, acceleration, etc, that would be required of the<br>
loaded sleigh.  The reindeer don't evaporate or incinerate because of this<br>
energy, they accelerate.  What do you think they have antlers for, fighting over<br>
females?  Think of antlers as furry solar array panels.<br>
7. If that's not enough, watch the news on the 24th at 11 o'clock.  NORAD<br>
(which may be one of the few government agencies with more than 3 initials in<br>
it's name and therefore it must be more trustworthy than the rest) tracks Santa<br>
every year and I've seen the radar shots of him approaching my house from the<br>
direction of the North Pole.  They haven't bombarded him yet, so they must<br>
believe too, right?</p>

<p>Jim Smith wished to buy a present for his sweetheart and after careful<br>
consideration, he decided on a pair of gloves.  Accompanied by his sweetheart's<br>
sister, he went to a department store and bought a pair of white gloves.  The<br>
sister purchased a pair of panties for herself.  During the wrapping, the items<br>
got mixed up.  (The sweetheart got the panties.)  Without checking the contents,<br>
Jim sealed his package and sent it to his sweetheart with the following note:</p>
<p>Dearest Darling,</p>
<p>This is a little gift to show you I have not forgotten you this Christmas.<br>
I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any<br>
when we go out in the evening.  If it had not been for your younger sister,<br>
I would have chosen the long ones with the buttons, but she wears the short<br>
ones that are easy to remove.  These are a delicate shade, but the lady I<br>
bought them from showed me a pair that she had worn for three weeks and they<br>
were hardly soiled.  I had the sales girl try them on and she really looked<br>
great.  I wish I could put them on you the first time.  No doubt, other men's<br>
hands will come in contact with them before I have the chance to see you again.<br>
When you take them off, blow in them before putting them away as they will<br>
naturally be a little damp from wearing.  Be sure to keep them on when you<br>
clean them or they might shrink.  I hope you like them and will wear them for<br>
me next Friday night.<br>
					All My Love,<br>
					Jimmy<br>
P.S.  Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year.<br>
Also, the sales girl showed me how they look when worn in the latest style -<br>
folded down with the fur showing.</p>

<p><b>Politically Correct Santa</b></p>
<p>'Twas the night before Christmas and Santa's a wreck...<br>
How to live in a world that's politically correct?<br>
His workers no longer would answer to &quot;Elves&quot;,<br>
&quot;Vertically Challenged&quot; they were calling themselves.<br>
And labor conditions at the north pole<br>
Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.<br>
Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,<br>
Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.<br>
And equal employment had made it quite clear<br>
That Santa had better not use just reindeer.<br>
So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,<br>
Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!<br>
The runners had been removed from his sleigh;<br>
The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.<br>
And people had started to call for the cops<br>
When they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.<br>
Second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.<br>
His fur trimmed red suit was called &quot;Unenlightened.&quot;<br>
And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,<br>
Rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose<br>
And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,<br>
Demanding millions in over-due compensation.<br>
So, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife,<br>
Who suddenly said she'd enough of this life,<br>
Joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz,<br>
Demanding from now on her title was Ms.<br>
And as for the gifts, why, he'd ne'er had a notion<br>
That making a choice could cause so much commotion.<br>
Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,<br>
Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.<br>
Nothing that might be construed to pollute.<br>
Nothing to aim. Nothing to shoot.<br>
Nothing that clamored or made lots of noise.<br>
Nothing for just girls. Or just for the boys.<br>
Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.<br>
Nothing that's warlike or non-pacific.<br>
No candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.<br>
Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.<br>
And fairy tales, while not yet forbidden,<br>
Were like Ken and Barbie, better off hidden.<br>
For they raised the hackles of those psychological<br>
Who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.<br>
No baseball, no football...someone could get hurt;<br>
Besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.<br>
Dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe;<br>
And Nintendo would rot your entire brain away.<br>
So Santa just stood there, disheveled, perplexed;<br>
He just could not figure out what to do next.<br>
He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,<br>
But you've got to be careful with that word today.<br>
His sack was quite empty, limp to the ground;<br>
Nothing fully acceptable was to be found.<br>
Something special was needed, a gift that he might<br>
Give to all without angering the left or the right.<br>
A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,<br>
Each group of people, every religion;<br>
Every ethnicity, every hue,<br>
Everyone, everywhere...even you.<br>
So here is that gift, it's price beyond worth...<br>
&quot;May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth.&quot;<br>

<p><b>Bubba Claus</b></p>
<p>To: All Concerned<br>
From: Santa Claus</p>
<p>I regret to inform you that, effective immediately, I will no longer serve the
States of Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Virginia, North and South Carolina,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas on Christmas
Eve.</p>
<p>Due to the overwhelming current population of the earth, my contract was
Renegotiated by North American Fairies and Elves Local 209. As part of the new
and better contract I also get longer breaks for milk and cookies so keep that
in mind.  However, I'm certain that your children will be in good hands with
your local replacement, who happens to be my third cousin, Bubba Claus. His side
of the family is from the South Pole. He shares my goal of delivering toys to
all the good boys and girls; however, there are a few differences between us.</p>
<p>Differences such as:</p>
<p>1. There is no danger of the Grinch stealing your presents from Bubba Claus.
He has a gun rack on his sleigh and a bumper sticker that reads: &quot;These toys
insured by Smith and Wesson.&quot;</p>
<p>2. Instead of milk and cookies, Bubba Claus prefers that children leave an RC
cola and pork rinds [or a moon pie] on the fireplace.  And Bubba doesn't smoke a
pipe.  He dips a little snuff though, so please have an empty spit can handy.</p>
<p>3. Bubba Claus' sleigh is pulled by floppy-eared, flying' coon dogs instead of
reindeer.  I made the mistake of loaning him one of my reindeer a long time ago,
and Blitzen's head now overlooks Bubba's fireplace.</p>
<p>4. You won't hear &quot;On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen..&quot; when Bubba Claus
arrives.  Instead, you'll hear, &quot;On Earnhardt, on Andretti, on Elliott and
Petty.&quot;</p>
<p>5. &quot;Ho, Ho, Ho!&quot; has been replaced by &quot;Yee Haw!&quot; And you also are likely to hear
Bubba's elves respond, &quot;I heeer'd dat!&quot;</p>
<p>6. As required by Southern highway laws, Bubba Claus' sleigh does have
a Yosemite Sam safety triangle on the back with the words &quot;Back Off&quot;.</p>
<p>7. The usual Christmas movie classics such as &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; and &quot;It's
a Wonderful Life&quot; will not be shown in your negotiated Viewing area.  Instead,
you'll see &quot;Boss Hogg Saves Christmas&quot; and &quot;Smokey and the Bandit IV&quot; featuring
Burt Reynolds as Bubba Claus and dozens of state patrol cars crashing into each
other.</p>
<p>And Finally,</p>
<p>8. Bubba Claus doesn't wear a belt.  If I were you, I'd make sure you, the wife,
and the kids turn the other way when he bends over to put presents under the
tree.</p>
<p>Sincerely Yours,</p>
<p>Santa Claus</p>

<p><b>The Twelve Days Of Christmas</b></p>
<p><i>Effective immediately, the following economizing measures are being implemented
in the &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; subsidiary:</i></p>
<p>1. The partridge will be retained, but the pear tree, which never produced the
cash crop forecasted, will be replaced by a plastic hanging plant, providing
considerable savings in maintenance;</p>
<p>2. Two turtle doves represent a redundancy that is simply not cost effective.
In Addition, their romance during working hours could not be condoned.
The positions are, therefore, eliminated;</p>
<p>3. The three French hens will remain intact. After all, everyone loves the French;</p>
<p>4. The four calling birds will be replaced by an automated voice mail system,
with a call waiting option.  An analysis is underway to determine who the birds
have been calling, how often and how long they talked;</p>
<p>5. The five golden rings have been put on hold by the Board of Directors.
Maintaining a portfolio based on one commodity could have negative implications
for institutional investors.  Diversification into other precious metals, as
well as a mix of T-Bills and high technology stocks, appear to be in order;</p>
<p>6. The six geese-a-laying constitutes a luxury which can no longer be afforded.
It has long been felt that the production rate of one egg per goose per day was
an example of the general decline in productivity.  Three geese will be let go,
and an upgrading in the selection procedure by personnel will assure management
that, from now on, every goose it gets will be a good one;</p>
<p>7. The seven swans-a-swimming is obviously a number chosen in better times.
The function is primarily decorative.  Mechanical swans are on order.
The current swans will be retrained to learn some new strokes, thereby enhancing
their outplacement;</p>
<p>8. As you know, the eight maids-a-milking concept has been under heavy scrutiny
by the EEOC. A male/female balance in the workforce is being sought.  The more
militant maids consider this a dead-end job with no upward mobility.  Automation
of the process may permit the maids to try a-mending, a-mentoring or a-mulching;</p>
<p>9. Nine ladies dancing has always been an odd number.  This function will be
phased out as these individuals grow older and can no longer do the steps;</p>
<p>10. Ten Lords-a-leaping is overkill.  The high cost of Lords, plus the expense
of international air travel, prompted the Compensation Committee to suggest
replacing this group with ten out-of-work congressmen.  While leaping ability
may be somewhat sacrificed, the savings are significant as we expect an
oversupply of unemployed congressmen this year;</p>
<p>11. Eleven pipers piping and twelve drummers drumming is a simple case of the
band getting too big.  A substitution with a string quartet, a cutback on new
music, and no uniforms, will produce savings which will drop right to the bottom
line;</p>
<p>Overall we can expect a substantial reduction in assorted people, fowl, animals
and related expenses.  Though incomplete, studies indicate that stretching
deliveries over twelve days is inefficient.  If we can drop ship in one day,
service levels will be improved.</p>
<p>Regarding the lawsuit filed by the attorney's association seeking expansion to
include the legal profession (&quot;thirteen lawyers-a-suing&quot;), a decision is
pending.</p>
<p>Deeper cuts may be necessary in the future to remain competitive.  Should that
happen, the Board will request management to scrutinize the Snow White Division
to see if seven dwarfs is the right number.</p>

<p><b>Christmas Dinner</b></p>
<p> A woman goes to her boyfriends' parents' house for Christmas dinner.
This is to be her first time meeting the family and she is very nervous.<br>
 They all sit down and begin eating a fine meal.  The woman is beginning to feel
a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousness and the broccoli casserole.<br>
 The gas pains are almost making her eyes water.  Left with no other choice,
she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out a dainty fart.
It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the poof.<br>
 Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked
over at the dog that had been snoozing under the woman's chair, and said in a
rather stern voice, &quot;Skippy!&quot;.<br>
 The woman thought, &quot;This is great!&quot; and a big smile came across her face.
A couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again.
This time, she didn't even hesitate.  She let a much louder and longer rrrrrip.<br>
 The father again looked at the dog and yelled, &quot;Dammit Skippy!&quot;.<br>
 Once again the woman smiled and thought &quot;Yes!&quot; A few minutes later the woman
had to let another rip.  This time she didn't even think about it.
She let rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing.<br>
 Once again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled,
&quot;Dammit Skippy, get away from her before she shits on you!&quot;</p>

 <i>Parent's Version. . .</i><br>
 An elderly man in Phoenix calls his son in New York and says, &quot;I hate to
ruin your day, but I have to tell you that your mother and I are divorcing;
forty-five years of misery is enough.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Pop, what are you talking about?&quot; the son screams.<br>
 &quot;We can't stand the sight of each other any longer,&quot; the old man says.
&quot;We're sick of each other, and I'm sick of talking about this, so you call your
sister in Chicago and tell her.&quot;<br>
 Frantic, the son calls his sister, who explodes on the phone.<br>
 &quot;Like hell they're getting divorced,&quot; she shouts, &quot;I'll take care of this.&quot;<br>
 She calls Phoenix immediately, and screams at the old man, &quot;You are NOT getting
divorced.  Don't do a single thing until I get there.  I'm calling my brother
back, and we'll both be there tomorrow.  Until then, don't do a thing, DO YOU
HEAR ME?&quot; and hangs up.<br>
 The old man hangs up his phone and turns to his wife.  &quot;Okay,&quot; he says,
&quot;They're coming for Christmas and paying their own fares.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Skiers' Dictionary</b></p>
<p>Alp:<br>
One of a number of ski mountains in Europe.
Also a shouted request for assistance made by a European.</p>
<p>Avalanche:<br>
One of the few actual perils skiers face that needlessly frighten
timid individuals away from the sport.  See also: Blizzard, First
Aid, Fracture, Frostbite, Hypothermia, Lift Collapse.</p>
<p>Bindings:<br>
Automatic mechanisms that protect skiers from serious injury during
a fall by releasing skis from boots, sending the skis skittering
across the slope where they trip two other skiers.</p>
<p>Bones:<br>
There are 206 in the human body.  No need for dismay, however;
the two bones of the middle ear have never been broken while skiing.</p>
<p>Cross-Country Skiing:<br>
Traditional Scandinavian all-terrain technique.  It's good exercise,
doesn't require purchase of costly lift tickets.  It has no crowds or lines.
See also Cross-Country Something-Or-Other.</p>
<p>Cross-Country Something-or-Other:<br>
Touring on skis along trails in scenic wilderness, gliding through
snow-hushed woods far from the hubbub of the ski slopes, hearing
nothing but the whispery hiss of the skis slipping through snow and
the muffled screams of other skiers dropping into the puffy powder
of a deep, wind-sculpted drift.</p>
<p>Exercises:<br>
A few simple warm-ups to make sure you're prepared for the slopes:<br>
 1) Tie a cinder block to each foot and climb a flight of stairs.<br>
 2) Sit on the outside of a fourth-story window ledge with your
skis on and your poles in your lap for at least 30 minutes.<br>
 3) Bind your legs together at the ankles, lie flat on the floor;
then, holding a banana in each hand, get to your feet.</p>
<p>Gloves:<br>
Designed to be tight around the wrist to restrict circulation,
but not so close-fitting as to allow any manual dexterity;
they should also admit moisture from the outside without permitting any dampness within to escape.</p>
<p>Gravity:<br>
One of four fundamental forces in nature that affect skiers.
The other three are the strong force, which makes bindings jam;
the weak force, which makes ankles give way on turns; and
electromagnetism, which produces dead batteries in expensive
ski-resort parking lots.  See Inertia.</p>
<p>Inertia:<br>
Tendency of a skier's body to resist changes in direction or speed
due to the action of Newton's First Law of Motion.  Goes along with
these other physical laws:<br>
 1) Two objects of different mass falling side by side will have
the same rate of descent, but the lighter one will have larger hospital and home care bills.<br>
 2) Matter can neither be created nor destroyed, but if it drops
out of a parka pocket, don't expect to encounter it again in our universe.<br>
 3) When an irresistible force meets an immovable object (see &quot;Tree&quot;)</p>
<p>Prejump:<br>
Maneuver in which an expert skier makes a controlled jump just ahead of a bump.
Beginners can execute a controlled pre-fall just before
losing their balance and, if they wish, may precede it with either
a pre-scream and a few pre-groans or simple profanity.</p>
<p>Shin:<br>
The bruised area on the front of the leg that runs from the point
where the ache from the wrenched knee ends to where the soreness
from the strained ankle begins.</p>
<p>Ski!:<br>
A shout to alert people ahead that a loose ski is coming down the hill.
Another warning skiers should be familiar with is &quot;Avalanche!&quot;
(which tells everyone that a hill is coming down the hill).</p>
<p>Skier:<br>
One who pays an arm and a leg for the opportunity to break them.</p>
<p>Stance:<br>
Your knees should be flexed, but shaking slightly; your arms
straight and covered with a good layer of goose flesh; your hands
forward, palms clammy, knuckles white and fingers icy, your eyes a
little crossed and darting in all directions.  Your lips should be
quivering, and you should be mumbling, &quot;Am I nuts or what?&quot;</p>
<p>Thor:<br>
The Scandinavian god of acheth and painth.</p>
<p>Traverse:<br>
To ski across a slope at an angle; one of two quick and simple methods of reducing speed.</p>
<p>Tree:<br>
The other method.</p>

 &quot;Christmas and the New Year are actually two holidays.  So there is a plural,

 As we get closer to Christmas, these Christmas tree lots try to rip you off because they know you're desperate. They know you need a tree.
I was at a lot last night. I went to buy a tree. Needles sold separately. I couldn't believe it.</p>

 I'm sure the new movies are good, but I'm upset there are no real Christmas movies.
Like &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; where Jimmy Stewart finds himself in a world where no one can see him.
It's like nobody's aware of his existence. I know that feeling.<br>
 &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; is the one where the angel earns his wings.
Because remember, kids, an angel without wings is like Tom Selleck without a moustache, or like &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; without a cast member going crazy.<br>
 Instead of remaking an old Christmas movie, maybe Hollywood could make a sequel to a Christmas movie that people liked. Like that Tim Allen movie, &quot;The Santa Clause.&quot;

 Between the seven swans a swimming, six geese a-laying, four calling birds, three French hens, two turtledoves and the partridge in the pear tree,
you are giving me 23 different birds. Now I have to take care of 23 birds? I'm not a farmer.<br>
 I could have used the ladies dancing and the maids a-milking, but now I'm married, and honestly they're more trouble than they're worth.</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, Dec 15, 2015:<br>
 They're saying that this could be one of the warmest Christmases in 30 years. Last Christmas, people left out milk and cookies for Santa.
This Christmas, people leave out a cool rag and a stick of Mitchum deodorant.<br>
 Last Christmas, Santa made a list of who's naughty or nice. This Christmas, Santa made a list of who has central air and who doesn't.<br>
 Last Christmas, you went to an ugly sweater party. This Christmas, you're going to an ugly, sweaty party.</p>

 Bush has sent an email to his supporters promising that as an early Christmas present, if you give him $25,
you won't receive any more email requests for cash the rest of the year. It's a political strategy borrowed from the mob.<br>
