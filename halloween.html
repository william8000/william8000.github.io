<p>THE TOP 25 REASONS YOU WON'T WIN THE HALLOWEEN COSTUME CONTEST</p>
<p>25. After your roommate insisted on being the front legs, you began to<br>
    suspect that a burrito dinner wasn't such a good idea.</p>
<p>24. Your &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; barfed in the judge's trick or treat bag.</p>
<p>23. The Nike swoosh -- while obscene to some -- is just not all that scary<br>
    emblazoned on a white sheet.</p>
<p>22. &quot;Hey!  Blue dress with a stain and a cigar!  Why didn't I think of that??&quot;</p>
<p>21. Somehow your Snoop Dog costume just didn't go over that big at the<br>
    Quayle house.</p>
<p>20. Your kindergarten students failed to see the humor in your<br>
    &quot;Road Kill Barney&quot; costume.</p>
<p>19. Unlike thousands of other Monica look-alikes, the semen on your dress<br>
    is not *really* the President's semen.</p>
<p>18. Although your &quot;Internal Bus Architecture of the Intel Celeron Chip&quot;<br>
    costume was a big hit with the other engineers at the office, things are<br>
    different out in the real world.</p>
<p>17. You can't get the zipper on your Bill Clinton costume to stay down.</p>
<p>16. In order to enter, you'd first have to log off the Internet -- and<br>
    pornography doesn't just read itself, now does it?</p>
<p>15. Looks like &quot;Viagra Man&quot; will be spending Halloween in jail for indecent<br>
    exposure.</p>
<p>14. Something in her eyes tells you there was an inherent flaw in your plan<br>
    of dressing up as the hostess's dead husband in order to get laid.</p>
<p>13. The Bride of Frankenstein had big, pointy hair and a small, round ass,<br>
    not the other way around.</p>
<p>12. 'Cause you should know that wearing a white sheet in Atlanta could only<br>
    lead to getting your ass whupped, Homeboy.</p>
<p>11. Your &quot;Naked Linda Tripp&quot; costume is actually more nauseating than scary.</p>
<p>10. Your &quot;Yanni&quot; costume got you beat up on the way to the party -- four times.</p>
<p>9. Your Dirk Diggler costume is merely embarrassing now that your &quot;Diggler&quot;<br>
   is stuck in the car door.</p>
<p>8. Your beret falls off every time you kneel.</p>
<p>7. Yellow Homer Simpson makeup?  Check.<br>
   Can of Homer Simpson &quot;Duff Beer&quot;?  Check.<br>
   Homer Simpson pants?  DOH!!!!</p>
<p>6. No one can tell whether you came as Abe Vigoda or Marge Schott.</p>
<p>5. This year's guest judge, Elizabeth Dole, has apparently never even *heard*<br>
   of Marilyn Manson.</p>
<p>4. Much to your surprise, three other people came dressed as Nikola Tesla,<br>
   father of alternating current.</p>
<p>3. The judges wrongly interpreted your &quot;Liposuction By-product&quot; costume as a<br>
   &quot;Bowl of Tapioca Pudding&quot; costume.</p>
<p>2. The only song you knew to go with the costume was &quot;Mammy,&quot; and the judges<br>
   at the NAACP party were not impressed.</p>
<p>1. *Nobody* likes a farting clown.</p>

Subject: A Day Late, So...If Anyone Is Missing Today ...<br>
Date: Wed, 01 Nov 2000 09:00 -0500 (EST)</p>
<p>With Halloween upon us, it is worthwhile to remember a few simple rules to<br>
help keep this season healthy, happy and SAFE!! Please use these helpful<br>
hints this and every year.</p>
<p>1. When it appears that you have killed the monster,<br>
   NEVER check to see if it's really dead.</p>
<p>2. Never read a book of demon summoning aloud, even as a joke.</p>
<p>3. Do not search the basement, especially if the power has gone out.</p>
<p>4. If your children speak to you in Latin or any other language which they<br>
   should not know, shoot them immediately. It will save you a lot of grief in<br>
   the long run. However, it will probably take several rounds to kill them, so<br>
   be prepared. This also applies to kids who speak with somebody else's voice.</p>
<p>5. As a general rule, don't solve puzzles that open portals to Hell.</p>
<p>6. Never stand in, on, or above a grave, tomb, or crypt.<br>
   This would apply to any other house of the dead as well.</p>
<p>7. If appliances start operating by themselves, do not check for<br>
   short-circuits; just get out.</p>
<p>8. Do not take ANYTHING from the dead.</p>
<p>9. If you find a town, which looks deserted, there's probably a good reason<br>
   for it. Don't stop and look around.</p>
<p>10. Don't fool with recombinant DNA technology unless you're sure you know<br>
    what you're doing.</p>
<p>11. If your companions suddenly begin to exhibit uncharacteristic<br>
    behavior such as hissing, fascination for blood, glowing eyes,<br>
    increasing hairiness, and so on, kill them immediately.</p>
<p>12. Stay away from certain geographical locations, some of which<br>
    are listed here: Amityville, Elm Street, Transylvania, and Nilbog<br>
    (you're in trouble if you recognize this one), anywhere in Texas where<br>
    chainsaws are sold, the Bermuda Triangle, or any small town in Maine.</p>
<p>13. If your car runs out of gas at night on a lonely road, do not go to the<br>
    nearby deserted-looking house to phone for help. If you think that it is<br>
    strange you ran out of gas because you thought you had most of a tank, shoot<br>
    yourself instead. You are going to die anyway, and most likely be eaten.</p>
<p>14. Beware of strangers bearing tools. For example: chainsaws, staple guns,<br>
    hedge trimmers, electric carving knives, combines, lawnmowers, butane<br>
    torches, soldering irons, band saws, or any devices made from deceased<br>
    companions.</p>
<p>15. If you find that your house is built upon a cemetery, now is the time to<br>
    move in with the in-laws. This also applies to houses that had previous<br>
    inhabitants who went mad or committed suicide or died in some horrible<br>
    fashion, or had inhabitants who performed satanic practices.</p>
<p>16. Dress appropriately. When investigating a noise downstairs in an old house,<br>
    women should not wear a flimsy negligee. And carry a flashlight, not a<br>
    candle.</p>
<p>17. Do not go looking for witches in the Maryland countryside.</p>
<p>18. If you're searching for something which caused a loud noise<br>
    and find out that it's just the cat, GET THE HECK OUT!</p>

<hr>
<p>Heard on Letterman, October 27, 2006:<br>
 Halloween is coming up.  Last year I ran out of candy by seven.  I had to
pass out old Sucrets I found in the bathroom.  After that I gave out Lipitor.<br>
 I remember Halloween.  When I was a kid mom dressed me up six years
in a row as a tramp.  High heels, fishnets... it was bad.<br>
 I'm going to try something different this year. This year I'm handing out bags of spinach.</p>
<p>Heard on Jay Leno, October 30, 2006:<br>
 Tomorrow is Halloween. At Dick Cheney's house instead of giving kids candy,
he waterboards them until they give up their candy.<br>
 In the United States it's called Halloween. In Mexico they have the Day of
the Dead. This is when they honor the souls that have disappeared to L.A.<br>
 Have you seen these &quot;fun size&quot; packages of candy? Why does the candy get smaller and our kids keep getting fatter?<br>
 Kids are so fat these days. In fact one of the popular costumes this year is a Mini Cooper.<br>
 Tonight on TV you can find all kinds of scary movies: &quot;Nightmare On Elm Street&quot;,
&quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;. In Detroit they're just showing reruns of the World Series.</p>
<p>Heard on Jay Leno, October 31, 2006:<br>
 Today is Halloween -- or as American kids call it &quot;Fat Tuesday!&quot;<br>
 Beverly Hills is the worst place for trick-or-treating. It's a little different here.
The kids email you pictures of them in costumes. Then they fax their candy list and you have it delivered by a messenger.<br>
 Michael Jackson calls trick-or-treating &quot;room service&quot;.<br>
 A popular costume this year is to wrap yourself up in bandages. Not a mummy. But going at Dick Cheney's hunting buddy.<br>
 A kid came to my door with a beer and a cigarette in his mouth. I said who are you supposed to be?
The kids replied, &quot;I'm Britney Spears' baby.&quot;<br>
 Another popular costume this year is Kim Jung Il. It's easy because all the clothes are kid size already.<br>
 Halloween is the scariest day of the year -- unless you're a Republican, then it's next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Heard on Jay Leno, November 1, 2006:<br>
 I saw an interesting costume last night. I heard at the knock at the door and found a guy with a foot in his mouth.
Turns out it was just John Kerry.<br>
 People are upset at a botched joke John Kerry said during one of his speeches.
Kerry was stunned. &quot;People listen to my speeches?&quot;</p>
<p>Heard on Jay Leno, November 2, 2006:<br>
 Last night I answered the door and kid says, &quot;Trick or treat!&quot; I said, &quot;Trick or treat?  Aren't you a few days late?&quot;
Then he responded, &quot;No, I'm dressed as a FEMA worker.&quot;</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, October 30, 2007:<br>
 Lot of candidates getting into the Halloween spirit.  Today, John Edwards said
he was going to get a $15 haircut and go as someone from the other America.<br>
 Even FEMA employees are celebrating Halloween. They're all getting dressed up as reporters this year.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, October 30, 2007:<br>
 Everyone excited about Halloween? Every year, they try to contact Houdini
on Halloween. And I thought, &quot;Wait a minute -- isn't that one of the good
things about being dead, not having to take calls?&quot;</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, October 31, 2007:<br>
 Happy Halloween, everyone. This is the day we teach our children,
&quot;Go ahead, take candy from strangers.&quot;<br>
 Dick Cheney had an awkward moment at the White House Halloween party.
He went dressed as Darth Vader. And at the party he ran into the real
Darth Vader who was dressed as Dick Cheney.</p>

<p>Heard on Conan, October 31, 2007:<br>
 It's Halloween, so this morning on the &quot;Today&quot; show, Matt Lauer dressed
up as Hermann Munster and Al Roker dressed up as a scary vampire.
Not only that -- Larry King went on his show without makeup.<br>
 This year Daylight Saving time has been extended.  This will allow
trick-or-treaters an extra hour for Halloween. Experts predict it will
be this final hour that will separate the fat from the husky.</p>
<p>Heard on Ferguson, October 31, 2007:<br>
 Happy Halloween! Halloween is a time when people wear crazy outfits, scary
makeup, and they do Satan's bidding ... as we call it here in LA, Wednesday.<br>
 Last year I went as a banana.  People said I looked like an overripe fruit.
And that was before I put on the costume.<br>
 Last year I went to west Hollywood party ... the guys there really dressed up.
One guy was like Judy Garland and one tiny guy was dressed as Tom Cruise.
To be fair, I think it was Tom Cruise.</p>
<p>Heard on Kimmel, October 31, 2007:<br>
 Britney Spears did a call-in to Ryan Seacrest's radio show this morning.
Half-way through the interview, she was suddenly gone.  Ryan asked her a
question and there was no response.  Her assistant said she went to take
a shower.  At least she's showering, we know that.<br>
 They called her back a little while later, and she didn't say much,
but she did talk about her Halloween costume.  She had a good idea.
She's going to go wearing panties.  So she will be totally unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Top Ten Signs You Are Watching A Bad Ghost Movie, Letterman, October 27, 2009:<br>

 2. Scariest thing is the size of the large soda they sell at the snack counter<br>
 1. Evil spirit does all of its haunting via Twitter</p>
<p>Heard on Conan, October 28, 2009:<br>
 One of the top-selling costumes this Halloween is a vampire version of
President Obama called &quot;Barakula&quot;.  Also very popular is the vampire version
of former Vice President Dick Cheney called &quot;Dick Cheney&quot;.</p>
<p>Heard on Kimmel, October 28, 2009:<br>
 Halloween is just days away.  Halloween is not for me.  Here in L.A., you take
the kids trick-or-treating and you come home with a pumpkin full of Kabbalah
bracelets and sushi.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, October 29, 2009:<br>
 Halloween is two days away. The kids love Halloween.
They love to bob for apples. That's a short trip to swine flu, right there.<br>
 Bobbing for apples, or as Dick Cheney calls it, &quot;appleboarding&quot;.</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, October 25, 2010:<br>
 Halloween is almost here and everyone is getting their costumes ready. This past weekend, I saw the New York Yankees pretending to be the Mets.</p>

<p>Heard on Kimmel, October 28, 2010:<br>
 Halloween is on Sunday, so make sure you have plenty of cigarettes for the kids.<br>
 Some parents ruin Halloween for their kids by not allowing them to get candy.
The way our economy is going, it may be good practice for our kids to start begging for food.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, October 29, 2010:<br>
 Remember when we used to worry about some weirdo having a razor blade inside
an apple on Halloween? Not anymore.  Like a kid today would eat an apple.<br>
 Here's a great way to scare Californians this Halloween. Remind them that our choice for governor is Meg Whitman or Jerry Brown.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, October 29, 2010:<br>
 When I was a kid, I liked Halloween. But now, it's just another reason to get drunk.<br>
 You don't have to go nuts buying treats for Halloween. Last year, I passed out Lipitor.<br>
 I hate the stupid games you have to play on Halloween, like bobbing for apples. Or, as Dick Cheney used to call it, &quot;apple-boarding&quot;.</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, October 29, 2010:<br>
 Halloween is this weekend. I'm just gonna get trashed and go as Charlie Sheen's hotel room.<br>
 I love it when people dress up their dogs in Halloween costumes.
But I don't like it when I tell someone how cute their dog looks, and they're like &quot;Hey man, that's my child.&quot;</p>
<p>Heard on Ferguson, October 29, 2010:<br>
 For Halloween, I'm going to be the most bedazzled ghost ever.<br>
 I'm too cheap to make a real costume. I'm just going to take everything off except for my socks, and I'll be Charlie Sheen.<br>
 I'm looking forward to Halloween, seeing all the monsters and the nightmarish imagery.
Then I'll turn off the campaign ads and wait for the trick-or-treaters.<br>
 I don't like when people make their lawns into graveyards with zombies writhing around on the ground.
If I want to see a scary creature twisted on the ground, I'd throw David Hasselhoff a hamburger.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, November 1, 2010:<br>
 I hope you all had a nice Halloween. How many are sick today from too much candy? How many are sick from too many political ads on TV?</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, November 1, 2010:<br>
 I ran out of candy on Halloween, and then realized I had some powdered milk left over from my Y2K bunker.</p>
<p>Heard on Kimmel, November 1, 2010:<br>
 No one came to my house to trick-or-treat. I think the moat might be scaring people away.<br>
 I have all this candy left at my house now. This morning, I had a Skittles omelet.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, October 27, 2011:<br>
 According to USA Today, 74 percent of Americans plan to hand out candy this Halloween.
Although President Obama thinks it should be just the top 1 percent.<br>
 Trick-or-treating is expected to climb for the 10th straight year.
Kids still love the candy, they just hate the walking.</p>
<p>Heard on Conan, October 27, 2011:<br>
 This year one of the most popular costumes is the Snooki costume. It's easy to make.
You just dress up as an orange pumpkin and pass out in a men's room.</p>
<p>Heard on Kimmel, October 27, 2011:<br>
 I hate having to find a Halloween costume. They turn these abandoned blockbuster video stores into Halloween costume cities.
And the costumes are all stupid. And the employees in the store do not care because they know they're fired on Nov. 1.<br>
 I miss the days when Halloween was a simple holiday about making ritual sacrifices to evil spirits to ensure a plentiful harvest.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, October 31, 2011:<br>
 President Obama invited trick-or-treaters to the White House Saturday night and they had a very scary party.
They sat in a circle, turned off all the lights and the kids read the president his poll numbers.<br>
 Earlier tonight, a bunch of rich kids came to my door, took all my candy and
the other 99 percent of the kids in the neighborhood are now occupying my lawn.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, October 31, 2011:<br>
 Halloween is the beginning of the holiday shopping season. That's for women.
The beginning of the holiday shopping season for men is Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>Heard on Conan, October 31, 2011:<br>
 I see a lot of Conan costumes. Hey, at least you can take yours off.</p>
<p>Heard on Ferguson, October 31, 2011:<br>
 I had trouble deciding on a costume today. I just thought I'd throw together whatever I had in my closet.
Luckily for me, everything I had looked like something worn by Moammar Gadhafi.<br>
 Halloween is really fun at my house. Every year, I buy a bunch of candy and as kids walk up the driveway, I turn on the sprinklers.</p>
<p>Heard on Kimmel, October 31, 2011:<br>
 It's kind of weird wearing a costume into an office.
What if you get fired? Nothing sadder than clearing out your things dressed like Dora the Explorer.<br>
 I wonder if Halloween is the one day of the year Lady Gaga wears sensible slacks.<br>
 Trick-or-treaters came to the White House for about an hour on Saturday.
Conservatives are already accusing the president of seriously depleting our country's Tootsie Roll reserve.</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, October 31, 2011:<br>
 An 80-year-old man in New York is doing fine after he fell into a sinkhole in his front yard.
Yeah, when kids saw an 80-year-old crawling out of a hole in the ground, they were like, &quot;That's the best Halloween display ever!&quot;</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, November 1, 2011:<br>
 I like Halloween. It gives you a chance to dress up like something you're not, you know? Like when the Miami Dolphins put on football uniforms.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, November 1, 2011:<br>
 Here's how I know that we had quite a few trick-or-treaters. I'm leaving the property this morning and the barbed wire is covered with ripped costumes.</p>
<p>Heard on Kimmel, November 1, 2011:<br>
 I hope you've recovered from Halloween. It came and went so fast -- like a Kardashian marriage.<br>
 A lot of kids across the country got the day off from school because of Halloween.
I'm pretty sure this is why we're falling behind China.
Not only did their kids not get the day off from school, they made all of our kids' costumes.<br>
 I think the scariest costume I saw was a woman dressed as the Creature from the Black Lagoon.
Either that or a real housewife of Beverly Hills had just come out of a Botox appointment.</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, November 1, 2011:<br>
 President Obama gave candy to trick-or-treaters at the White House.
Obama wanted people to like his costume, so he went as himself from 2008.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, October 31, 2012:<br>
 I had a trick-or-treater tonight who stood outside on my porch for an hour, didn't ring the bell, didn't knock on the door.
I said, &quot;Who are you supposed to be?&quot; He said, &quot;I'm an undecided voter.&quot;<br>
 My favorite Halloween candy is the candy corn. It comes in four colors: white, yellow, orange, brown. Those are also the stages of your teeth rotting after you eat it.<br>
 Donald Trump, did you see him today? He was giving candy only to kids who could show their birth certificate and their school records.</p>
<p>Heard on Conan, November 1, 2012:<br>
 Last night Lady Gaga dressed up as a marijuana plant. Then 20 minutes later she realized it was Halloween, so she ran home and put on a costume.</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, October 30, 2013:<br>
 Halloween is tomorrow night, and a woman from North Dakota says she's planning on giving overweight trick-or-treaters a letter explaining that sugar is bad for them
instead of giving them candy. Then those kids will hand HER a letter saying, &quot;Toilet paper or eggs?&quot;</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, November 1, 2013:<br>
 Did everybody have a good Halloween? I'm just not into the Halloween spirit. What I did was I went to bed early after I turned on the electric fence. <br>
 Last year for Halloween I passed out Lipitor. Is that all right?</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, November 1, 2013:<br>
 Last night the Obamas gave out dried fruit to more than 5,000 trick-or-treaters.
In a related story, today workers outside the White House had to sweep up a bunch of dried fruit.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, November 12, 2013:<br>
 My wife got a hold of some bacon-scented deodorant and then she found some fried eggs cologne.
And then for Halloween we went trick-or-treating as a Denny's Grand Slam breakfast.</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, October 3, 2016:<br>
 We're just four weeks away from Halloween: people pretending to be somebody else, going door-to-door for handouts, or as that's also called, running for president.</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, October 31, 2016:<br>
 It is Halloween, which means you just spent the night handing out candy, or you've been sitting completely still in the dark, pretending that you weren't home.<br>
 I saw a new study that says that eating over 1,500 pieces of candy corn could actually kill you.
Which shouldn't be a problem since the current record for eating a piece of candy corn is two.<br>
 Hillary Clinton got quite a scare tonight. I guess a trick-or-treater came to the door dressed as a lie detector.<br>
 When kids rang Donald Trump's bell and yelled, &quot;Trick or treat,&quot; Trump yelled &quot;Trick,&quot; and before the kids could grab any candy, declared bankruptcy. Boom, just like that.</p>
<p>Heard on Corden, October 31, 2016:<br>
 It makes sense on the weekend of Halloween that Donald Trump's campaign comes back from the dead for one final scare.</p>
<p>Heard on Kimmel, October 31, 2016:<br>
 Imagine what an amazing place America would be if we put as much time and effort as we do into our Halloween costumes into literally anything else.<br>
 According to a survey of over 40,000 Americans, candy corn was the most popular Halloween candy state by state.
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups got the most votes overall. So basically, Reese's got the popular vote and candy corn won the Electoral College.<br>
 The bigger question is who the hell loves candy corn so much? I mean, was this a survey of people with no teeth?<br>
 In Arizona, the favored Halloween candy is Toblerone. That's when you know you have too many old people living in your state.
Where do you even get Toblerone? Are children trick-or-treating at duty-free shops at the airport? I haven't seen Toblerone outside of that.</p>
<p>Heard on Meyers, October 31, 2016:<br>
 Today was Halloween and right on cue, Hillary's private email server came back from the dead.</p>

question to ask you but I don't want to offend you.&quot;<br>
 She answers, &quot;My dear son, you cannot offend me.  When you're as old as I am and
have been a nun as long as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just about
everything.  I'm sure that there's nothing you could say or ask that I would
find offensive.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Well, I've always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me.&quot;<br>
 She responds, &quot;Well, let's see what we can do about that: #1, you have to be
single and #2 you must be Catholic.&quot;<br>
 The cab driver is very excited and says, &quot;Yes, I am single and I'm Catholic
too!&quot; &quot;OK&quot; the nun says &quot;Pull into the next alley.&quot;<br>
 He does and the nun fulfills his fantasy with a kiss that would make a hooker blush.<br>
 But when they get back on the road, the cab driver starts crying.<br>
 &quot;My dear child, said the nun, why are you crying?&quot;<br>
 &quot;Forgive me sister, but I have sinned.  I lied, I must confess,
I'm married and I'm Jewish.&quot;<br>
 The nun says, &quot;That's OK, my name is Kevin and I'm on my way to a Halloween party.&quot;</p>

4. c. Samhain<br>

<p>1. Candy Corn. According to ExtremeChocolate.com's annual Halloween
candy survey, Candy Corn was the most popular Halloween candy in 2004.
In previous years, Snickers had held the #1 spot.</p>
<p>2. Your future spouse.  According to superstition, if you stare into a mirror
at midnight on Halloween, you will see your future spouse.</p>
<p>3. Turnips. The first Jack-o-Lanterns were made in Ireland out of hollowed-out
turnips.  A piece of coal was inserted into the hollow and the &quot;lantern&quot; was
meant to guide the way of poor old Jack who wasn't welcome in Heaven but was
also barred from entering Hell for tricking the devil.  According to legend,
the devil gave this crude lamp to Jack so that he could walk the earth forever
in limbo.  When the Irish brought this tradition to America, they apparently
decided that pumpkins were much easier to carve than turnips, and the
modern-day Jack-o-Lantern was born!</p>
<p>4. Samhain. Although there are many theories on the origin and history of
Halloween, it is generally accepted that Halloween dates back to an ancient
Celtic festival known as Samhain, or the Celtic New Year. It was believed that
the spirits of everyone who had died during the year would return on the eve of
Samhain to seek living bodies to possess for the following year.  The Celts
would dress in ghoulish costumes and hold noisy revels in an attempt to frighten
away these spirits.  Food and drink was also offered to pacify the dead.
There are many tales of unfortunate souls being burned at the stake because
they were perceived to have been possessed by one of the returning spirits.
Around the turn of the first century AD, Romans abandoned this custom of
human sacrifice in favor of the burning of effigies.</p>
<p>5. Spiderman. According to the National Retail Federation's Halloween Consumer
Intentions and Actions Survey, the most popular Halloween costume in 2004 was
Spiderman, with 2.15 million children dressing as their favorite superhero.
Other popular costumes included princesses (1.8 million children), witches
(1.3 million) and vampires (899,000).</p>
<p>6. 1,385!! The world's record for biggest pumpkin is currently held by
a gigantic gourd weighing a whopping 1,385 pounds!</p>
<p>7. A werewolf. According to legend, a unibrow, tattoos, hairy palms,
and a long middle finger are all signs of a werewolf.</p>
<p>8. 24lbs! The average American consumed 24 pounds of candy in 2002!
It is believed that a large portion is consumed by kids on and during
the days immediately following Halloween.</p>
<p>9. None. None of the &quot;witches&quot; put to death in the Salem Witch trials were
burned at the stake.  All those executed were hanged but one, Giles Cory, who
was pressed to death.  Several others died in prison, including Sarah Osborne,
Roger Toothaker, Lyndia Dustin, and Ann Foster.</p>
<p>10. Samhainophobia. Samhainophobia refers to an abnormal and persistent fear of
Halloween. This time of year may also stir up other phobias such as the fear of
cats (ailurophobia), witches (wiccaphobia), ghosts (phasmophobia), spiders
(arachnophobia), the dark (nyctophobia), and cemeteries (coimetrophobia).</p>
