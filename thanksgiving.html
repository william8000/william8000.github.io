Thanksgiving Day Jokes<br>

<b>Twas The Night Of Thanksgiving</b>
<p> 'Twas the night of Thanksgiving, but I just couldn't sleep.<br>
 I tried counting backwards, I tried counting sheep.<br>
 The leftovers beckoned - the dark meat and white,<br>
 But I fought the temptation with all of my might.</p>
<p> Tossing and turning with anticipation,<br>
 The thought of a snack became infatuation.<br>
 So, I raced to the kitchen, flung open the door<br>
 And gazed at the fridge, full of goodies galore.</p>
<p> I gobbled up turkey and buttered potatoes,<br>
 Pickles and carrots, beans and tomatoes.<br>
 I felt myself swelling so plump and so round,<br>
 'Til all of a sudden, I rose off the ground.</p>
<p> I crashed through the ceiling, floating into the sky,<br>
 With a mouthful of pudding and a handful of pie.<br>
 But, I managed to yell as I soared past the trees....<br>
 Happy eating to all, pass the cranberries, please.</p>
<p> May your stuffing be tasty, your turkey be plump.<br>
 Your potatoes 'n gravy have nary a lump.<br>
 May your yams be delicious, your pies take the prize.<br>
 May your Thanksgiving dinner stay off of your thighs.</p>

 His family was fond of the leg portion for dinner and there were never enough legs for everyone.<br>
 After many frustrating attempts, the farmer was relating the results of his efforts to his friends at the general store get together.
&quot;Well I finally did it! I bred a turkey that has 6 legs!&quot;<br>
 They all asked the farmer how it tasted.<br>
 &quot;I don't know&quot; said the farmer. &quot;I never could catch the darn thing!&quot;</p>
<hr>

<p> &quot;I can't wait to go to Grandma's for Thanksgiving.
My cousin's going to be there, and he has three feet!&quot;<br>
 &quot;Wow - how'd that happen?&quot;<br>
 &quot;I don't know.  My aunt wrote my parents and said,
'You won't recognize little Howard - he's grown another foot!'&quot;</p>
<p>I don't think I'll attend this year's Thanksgiving dinner.
My wife gave me a haircut this morning.
And now she said she's going to make Thanksgiving Day dinner with all the trimmings.</p>

<p>A lady was picking through frozen turkeys at a grocery store for Thanksgiving Day, but couldn't find one big enough for her family.
She asked a stock boy, &quot;Do these turkeys get any bigger?&quot;
&quot;No, ma'am. They're dead,&quot; he replied.</p>
<p>Last Thanksgiving, I had my chance to do the traditional thing of shooting my own turkey. Man, you should have seen the people scatter in the meat department.</p>
<p>When everyone at the table takes turns saying what they are thankful for, say, &quot;I'm thankful I didn't get caught,&quot; and refuse to say anything more.</p>
<p> If you were asked to bring paper plates and drinks to Thanksgiving... <br>
 Your family doesn't like your cooking.</p>

<p><b>A Bird Named Steve</b></p>
<p> There once was a man named Paul. He was very quiet and nice and never yelled or sweared.<br>
 He had a bird named Steve. Steve was very rude. He was always burping, yelling, or cursing.<br>
 One day, Paul just had enough of Steve's nonsense.  So he grabbed Steve by the
neck and threw him in the freezer.  Paul could hear the sound of Steve kicking
and screaming and cussing through the freezer door.  All of a sudden, the noise stopped.<br>
 Paul thought that he hurt the bird, so he went over to his fridge and opened up
his freezer.  Steve hopped out onto Paul's shoulder and looked him in the eyes.<br>
 &quot;I am so very sorry for my terrible behavior.  You are very kind to take care
of me, and if you could find it in you heart to forgive me, I would appreciate
it very much,&quot; Steve said.<br>
 &quot;It's okay, Steve. I am sorry for doing that to you,&quot; said Paul.<br>
 &quot;No harm done,&quot; Steve said.<br>
 Steve looked back at the freezer for a moment. &quot;By the way, what did the Turkey do?&quot;</p>

<p>Heard on Leno, Nov 22, 2006:<br>
 Today is the busiest travel day of the year.  Over 38 million people will
be traveling -- and that's just the people coming over from Mexico.<br>
 For those of you flying, you can only carry three ounces of gravy with you.<br>
 Thanksgiving is a day we spend with relatives. Or as Donald Rumsfeld calls it, acceptable torture.<br>
 I went down to the animal shelter and adopted a stray turkey. They taste just as good as the other ones.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, Nov 22, 2006:<br>
 Tomorrow is the big Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
Sorry kids no Kramer balloon this year.<br>
 Thanksgiving is a lot of fun.  All my relatives come to town.  I picked mom
up at the airport.  It was embarrassing.  We had to wait for a frozen
butterball to come down the luggage pickup.<br>
 Mom is a tremendous cook though.  You know how turkey makes you sleepy?
Well mom figured something out to counteract that.  What she does is the
night before, she marinates that turkey in Red Bull.<br>
 Today President Bush pardoned two turkeys at the White House. The turkeys end
up a petting zoo in Virginia. It's the same thing they did with Mark Foley.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, Nov 23, 2006:<br>
 You can tell it's Thanksgiving. The price of gravy was up to $70 a barrel today.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, Nov 23, 2006:<br>
 The weather wasn't very good for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
It was so bad that Michael Richards was screaming at Al Roker.<br>
 A horrible thing happened during the parade.
The Garfield balloon got loose and it killed a rat.<br>
 Did you see the Ronald McDonald balloon?  I didn't think it
was as much fun this year without the transfats.<br>
 We had Thanksgiving at my house.  My mom lost her cell phone.
We turned the place upsides down looking for it.
Then later in the afternoon the turkey started to vibrate.<br>
 Dick Cheney was in Iraq visiting the troops. Because nothing
says warm holiday cheer like a Dick Cheney sneer.<br>
 In Washington, D.C. a confused George W. Bush lit a menorah.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, Nov 24, 2006:<br>
 Do you get drowsy on Thanksgiving? It's the chemical in the turkey.
Here's what my mom does.  She has a little secret.  Before she puts
the turkey in the oven she puts a nicotine patch on it.<br>
 The national turkey was pardoned this week by President Bush. It was later adopted by Madonna.<br>
 There was also a second turkey that got a pardon this year - Donald Rumsfeld.<br>
 Today is the busiest shopping day of the year.  I went out today.
It was aggressive.  I got pushed, I got shoved, I got groped.
Heck I'm going back tomorrow!</p>
<p>David Letterman's Top Ten Things Overheard At The Late Show Thanksgiving Dinner, Nov 27, 2006:<br>
 10. I hear the turkey was a stupid pet trick that didn't work out.<br>
  9. So we have to do a show just because Letterman's family doesn't want him around?<br>
  8. Tryptophan? Great, one more reason for the audience to fall asleep.<br>
  7. Okay, turkey with stuffing and a slice of pie, that'll be $19.50.<br>
  6. This is more awkward than Kramer's apology.<br>
  5. Just so everyone knows, this also counts as your Christmas party.<br>
  4. Anyone who ate the creamed peas please report to the Late Show health officer.<br>
  3. Ooh, Wal-Mart wine!<br>
  2. Whenever there's free food, Regis shows up.<br>
  1. Hold Letterman down, I'll grab his toupee.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, Nov 27, 2006:<br>
 It takes five hours to serve turkey in Beverly Hills. Everyone has five dads,
so each needs to carve the turkey.  There's the real dad, the step dad, the
donor dad...<br>
 Have you heard about the tur-duck-en?  Very popular.  A chicken inside a duck
inside a turkey.  They now have Tum-alka-pepto after you eat a tur-duc-ken.
It's a Tums stuck to an Alka-Seltzer covered in Pepto Bismal.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, Nov 30, 2009:<br>
 Thanksgiving is over.  It was kind of an awkward one for John Edwards.
His relatives asked him to bring his favorite side dish, and he showed up
with a cocktail waitress.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, Nov 15, 2010:<br>
 This will be a rough week for President Obama. He's got a lame duck Congress, he has to pardon a turkey,
he has to eat crow, and the Chinese just flipped him the bird.  It's been a fowl week.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, Nov 23, 2010:<br>
 Sarah Palin has another new book. As long as somebody else is writing them for you, you can turn them out just like that.<br>
 That's right, Palin has a brand new book. And you thought <b>Thanksgiving dinner</b> makes you drowsy.<br>
 George W. Bush has a new book called &quot;Decision Points&quot;. I know many of you have made a decision not to read it.</p>
<p>Heard on Kimmel, Nov 23, 2010:<br>
 Palin's book &quot;America by Heart&quot; came out today, just in time for awkward holiday gift exchanges.</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, Nov 23, 2010:<br>
 The TSA has issued some special packing tips for travelers before Thanksgiving weekend.
They say not to bring food, sharp tools, or any shred of dignity.</p>
<p>Heard on Conan, Nov 23, 2010:<br>
 A company in San Francisco is coming out with &quot;gluttony pants&quot; specifically designed for overeating.
Or, as Americans call them, &quot;pants&quot;.</p>
<p>Heard on Conan, Nov 12, 2013:<br>
 Wal-Mart announced that this Thanksgiving they are opening earlier than they ever have.
Because what better way to celebrate the pilgrims' arrival than buying crap from China.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, Nov 12, 2013:<br>
 CBS has a wonderful new special. It's &quot;Thanksgiving at the Incognitos&quot; starring Richie Incognito.
He's the bullying guy from the Miami Dolphins. In this special, Richie stuffs a turkey into a locker.</p>
<p>Heard on Kimmel, Nov 12, 2013:<br>
 For the first time in 32 years, Butterball is adding male staffers to their Thanksgiving turkey talk line,
the phone number you can call if you are having trouble cooking your turkey.
One of the guys just yells questions to his wife in the other room.<br>
 Men are taking over turkey duties partly because women are focused on a cherished Thanksgiving tradition -- shopping on Black Friday.
Some retailers plan to open on Thanksgiving day itself.
If you're shopping for Christmas on Thanksgiving day, you either love or really hate your family, I'm not sure which.<br>
 If only there were some kind of device that would allow us to purchase things while wearing pajamas
and have them shipped directly to our homes so we wouldn't have to shop on Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, Nov 15, 2013:<br>
 Are you all getting ready for Thanksgiving? PETA says today's turkeys are so fat, they can't stand up, they're prone to heart attacks, and they have trouble mating.
No, I'm sorry, that's what the turkeys are saying about us. I had it backward.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, Nov 19, 2013:<br>
 Thanksgiving is right around the corner.
As you know, the traditional Thanksgiving began in 1621 when Native Americans sat down with a bunch of undocumented pilgrims.
They had dinner and the pilgrims never left.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, Nov 19, 2013:<br>
 There's a turkey shortage. Are you aware of that fact?
There's also a gravy shortage. It's up to $4 a gallon.
Governor Chris Christie wants to build a gravy pipeline.</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, Nov 19, 2013:<br>
 Butterball, the country's largest turkey producer, says it has a shortage of large Thanksgiving turkeys this year.
Some experts say it's because of a greater demand than usual, while others say it means the turkeys are on to us.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, Nov 25, 2013:<br>
 PETA says that today's turkeys are being bred to have such large breasts, they're dying of heart attacks.
I don't want to be insensitive, but that's still better than getting your head chopped off.<br>
 A report issued today said half of all Americans will be facing diabetes by the year 2020. The other half will have diabetes by Friday morning.<br>
 President Obama's approval rating is at 37 percent, the lowest point of his presidency. Here's how bad it is.
You know the Thanksgiving turkey he's pardoning this week? The turkey said: No pictures. It didn't want to be seen.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, Nov 25, 2013:<br>
 Are you aware of the turkey shortage? The White House has stepped in so people won't panic.
They said yes, there's a turkey shortage, but don't worry, it's only a website problem.<br>
 They said if you like the turkey you had last year, you can keep the turkey you had last year.<br>
 This year Thanksgiving and the first day of Hanukkah are on the same day. I'm no theologian, but I think what that means is eight days of leftovers.<br>
 The forecast for Thursday is a wintery mix of rain, freezing rain, sleet, and snow. I feel so bad for the guy who has to deliver my pizza that day.</p>
<p>Heard on Kimmel, Nov 25, 2013:<br>
 Thanksgiving travel will be especially unpleasant because of the big storm.
More than 500 flights out of Dallas-Fort Worth were canceled.
I think this is God's way of saying: Stay home and overcook your own turkey.</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, Nov 25, 2013:<br>
 They're saying a major winter storm is heading east, which could affect millions of Americans on the busiest travel day of the year.
Bad news is, you won't get to break the wishbone with your relatives this year. The good news is, that's probably the wish you made last year.</p>
<p>Heard on Leno, Nov 26, 2013:<br>
 In 1941, Congress ruled that the fourth Thursday in November would officially be observed as Thanksgiving Day - thus making it the last time Congress accomplished anything.<br>
 You can tell Thanksgiving is getting closer. In fact, today, five turkeys from the United States showed up at the Moscow airport seeking asylum.<br>
 The traditional Thanksgiving began in what year? 1621. And soon afterward, the Indians realized they had a failed immigration policy.</p>
<p>Heard on Letterman, Nov 26, 2013:<br>
 Thanksgiving is the best. I was so pleased last year. Things were going great, having a lot of fun,
the house was full of people, everybody getting along - and then I realized that by mistake I had picked up the wrong family at the airport.<br>
 I remember one year Mom was fixing Thanksgiving dinner, the turkey is in the oven, and she's tearing the house apart looking for her cellphone.
Later, we're all sitting down to eat and the turkey starts to ring.<br>
 For the first time this year, the Butterball turkey hotline has male operators answering the phone.
Depending on your turkey needs, you can request a female operator, a male operator, a male operator dressed as a female operator, or a female operator with a mustache.</p>
<p>Heard on Kimmel, Nov 26, 2013:<br>
 It's that special time of year when your whole family gathers together in one place to look at their cellphones.
And I'm going to start dinner by telling my parents I'm gay. It never gets old!<br>
 After Thanksgiving, we take a sharp nose-dive into what is probably the worst day of the year, Black Friday.
Some shoppers have been sleeping outside the stores since Monday of last week. That is nuts - and a very good way to get on the local news.</p>

 Jon Stewart: &quot;I celebrated Thanksgiving in an old-fashioned way. I invited everyone in my neighborhood to my house,
we had an enormous feast, and then I killed them and took their land.&quot;<br>
 Jim Gaffigan: &quot;Thanksgiving. It's like we didn't even try to come up with a tradition. The tradition is, we overeat.
'Hey, how about at Thanksgiving we just eat a lot?' 'But we do that every day!' 'Oh. What if we eat a lot with people that annoy the hell out of us?'&quot;<br>
 Stephen Colbert: &quot;Thanksgiving is a magical time of year when families across the country join together to raise America's obesity statistics.
Personally, I love Thanksgiving traditions: watching football, making pumpkin pie, and saying the magic phrase that sends your aunt storming
out of the dining room to sit in her car.&quot;<br>
 Kevin James: &quot;Thanksgiving, man. Not a good day to be my pants.&quot;<br>
 Jack Handey: &quot;If you're at a Thanksgiving dinner, but you don't like the stuffing or the cranberry sauce or anything else,
just pretend like you're eating it, but instead, put it all in your lap and form it into a big mushy ball.
Then, later, when you're out back having cigars with the boys, let out a big fake cough and throw the ball to the ground.
Then say, 'Boy, these are good cigars!'&quot;<br>
 Jay Leno: &quot;You can tell you ate too much for Thanksgiving when you have to let your bathrobe out.&quot;<br>
 Johnny Carson: &quot;Thanksgiving is an emotional holiday. People travel thousands of miles to be with people they only see once a year.
And then discover once a year is way too often.&quot;<br>
 George Carlin: &quot;We're having something a little different this year for Thanksgiving. Instead of a turkey, we're having a swan. You get more stuffing.&quot;<br>
 Greg Proops: Ever since you're little you hear this: 'The pilgrims left England to escape religious persecution and sneak religious freedom
into the new world.' But even when you're little you're like, 'Umm.. Bullsh*t?'&quot;</p>
<p>Heard on Colbert, Nov 23, 2015:<br>
 This Thanksgiving I'm feeling a little betrayed because it has just been revealed that the grocery store labels on the turkey mean very little.
Fresh, young, natural, meaningless.<br>
 Apparently fresh turkey just means it's not fully frozen.  Young turkey means they weren't allowed to die of old age.
Natural turkey has the same legal standing as cheez with two Es and a Z and wild turkey means you're too drunk to care anymore.<br>
 The point is it seems like the only ones you can trust these days are the good people at Butterball. They're all about helping you understand your turkey.
In fact, Butterball's been running a toll-free hotline for turkey-cooking tips since 1981.<br>
 Every year the turkey talk line receives more than 100,000 phone calls, but sadly, they have not once been able to save the turkey's life.<br>
 While the hotline opens on November 2nd, not surprisingly the volume peaks on Thanksgiving Day, so right now, Butterball is paying Turkey experts to sit by the phone.
But no one is calling.</p>
<p>Heard on Fallon, Nov 24, 2015:<br>
 I saw that NBC has officially granted Mike Huckabee, John Kasich, Jim Gilmore and Lindsey Graham free airtime to equal Donald Trump's recent Saturday Night Live appearance.
When asked how they'll feature the candidates, NBC was like,â&quot;Let's just say the Thanksgiving Day Parade just got a few more clowns.&quot;<br>
 I heard that AMC will broadcast a marathon of the entire &quot;Godfather&quot; trilogy on Thanksgiving.
So if you want to watch a dramatic family falling apart on Thanksgiving - now you've got TWO ways to do that.</p>
<p>Heard on Meyers, Nov 21, 2017:<br>
 Pringles has launched several new potato chip flavors including turkey, stuffing, mashed potato, green bean casserole, and pumpkin pie.
Or as single dads call it, &quot;Thanksgiving!&quot;</p>
